For a detailed introduction to the different components of a Docker container, check outThe Docker Ecosystem: An Introduction to Common Components.There are two methods for installing Docker on Ubuntu 16.04. One method involves installing it on an existing installation of the operating system. The other involves spinning up a server with a tool calledDocker Machinethat auto-installs Docker on it.In this tutorial, you\\'ll learn how to install and use it on an existing installation of Ubuntu 16.04.PrerequisitesTo follow this tutorial, you will need the following:64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 serverNon-root user with sudo privilegesInitial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to set this up.)Note:Docker requires a 64-bit version of Ubuntu as well as a kernel version equal to or greater than 3.10. The default 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 server meets these requirements.All the commands in this tutorial should be run as a non-root user. If root access is required for the command, it will be preceded bysudo.Initial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to add users and give them sudo access.Step 1 — Installing DockerThe Docker installation package available in the official Ubuntu 16.04 repository may not be the latest version. To get the latest and greatest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository. This section shows you how to do just that.First, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -Add the Docker repository to APT sources:sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\"Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:sudo apt-get updateMake sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:apt-cache policy docker-ceYou should see output similar to the follow:Output of apt-cache policy docker-cedocker-ce:\\r\\n  Installed: (none)\\r\\n  Candidate: 17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial\\r\\n  Version table:\\r\\n     17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\\r\\n        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages\\r\\n     17.03.0~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\\r\\n        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 PackagesNotice thatdocker-ceis not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 16.04. Thedocker-ceversion number might be different.Finally, install Docker:sudo apt-get install -y docker-ceDocker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it\\'s running:sudo systemctl status dockerThe output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:Output● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine\\r\\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\\r\\n   Active:active (running)since Sun 2016-05-01 06:53:52 CDT; 1 weeks 3 days ago\\r\\n     Docs: https://docs.docker.com\\r\\n Main PID: 749 (docker)Installing Docker now gives you not just the Docker service (daemon) but also thedockercommand line utility, or the Docker client. We\\'ll explore how to use thedockercommand later in this tutorial.Step 2 — Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo (Optional)By default, running thedockercommand requires root privileges — that is, you have to prefix the command withsudo. It can also be run by a user in thedockergroup, which is automatically created during the installation of Docker. If you attempt to run thedockercommand without prefixing it withsudoor without being in the docker group, you\\'ll get an output like this:Outputdocker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?.\\r\\nSee \\'docker run --help\\'.If you want to avoid typingsudowhenever you run thedockercommand, add your username to thedockergroup:sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}To apply the new group membership, you can log out of the server and back in, or you can type the following:su - ${USER}You will be prompted to enter your user\\'s password to continue. Afterwards, you can confirm that your user is now added to thedockergroup by typing:id -nGOutputsammysudo dockerIf you need to add a user to thedockergroup that you\\'re not logged in as, declare that username explicitly using:sudo usermod -aG dockerusernameThe rest of this article assumes you are running thedockercommand as a user in the docker user group. If you choose not to, please prepend the commands withsudo.Step 3 — Using the Docker CommandWith Docker installed and working, now\\'s the time to become familiar with the command line utility. Usingdockerconsists of passing it a chain of options and commands followed by arguments. The syntax takes this form:docker [option] [command] [arguments]To view all available subcommands, type:dockerAs of Docker 1.11.1, the complete list of available subcommands includes:Outputattach    Attach to a running container\\r\\n    build     Build an image from a Dockerfile\\r\\n    commit    Create a new image from a container\\'s changes\\r\\n    cp        Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem\\r\\n    create    Create a new container\\r\\n    diff      Inspect changes on a container\\'s filesystem\\r\\n    events    Get real time events from the server\\r\\n    exec      Run a command in a running container\\r\\n    export    Export a container\\'s filesystem as a tar archive\\r\\n    history   Show the history of an image\\r\\n    images    List images\\r\\n    import    Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image\\r\\n    info      Display system-wide information\\r\\n    inspect   Return low-level information on a container or image\\r\\n    kill      Kill a running container\\r\\n    load      Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN\\r\\n    login     Log in to a Docker registry\\r\\n    logout    Log out from a Docker registry\\r\\n    logs      Fetch the logs of a container\\r\\n    network   Manage Docker networks\\r\\n    pause     Pause all processes within a container\\r\\n    port      List port mappings or a specific mapping for the CONTAINER\\r\\n    ps        List containers\\r\\n    pull      Pull an image or a repository from a registry\\r\\n    push      Push an image or a repository to a registry\\r\\n    rename    Rename a container\\r\\n    restart   Restart a container\\r\\n    rm        Remove one or more containers\\r\\n    rmi       Remove one or more images\\r\\n    run       Run a command in a new container\\r\\n    save      Save one or more images to a tar archive\\r\\n    search    Search the Docker Hub for images\\r\\n    start     Start one or more stopped containers\\r\\n    stats     Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics\\r\\n    stop      Stop a running container\\r\\n    tag       Tag an image into a repository\\r\\n    top       Display the running processes of a container\\r\\n    unpause   Unpause all processes within a container\\r\\n    update    Update configuration of one or more containers\\r\\n    version   Show the Docker version information\\r\\n    volume    Manage Docker volumes\\r\\n    wait      Block until a container stops, then print its exit codeTo view the switches available to a specific command, type:dockerdocker-subcommand--helpTo view system-wide information about Docker, use:docker infoStep 4 — Working with Docker ImagesDocker containers are run from Docker images. By default, it pulls these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry managed by Docker, the company behind the Docker project. Anybody can build and host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so most applications and Linux distributions you\\'ll need to run Docker containers have images that are hosted on Docker Hub.To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:docker run hello-worldThe output, which should include the following, should indicate that Docker in working correctly:OutputHello from Docker.\\r\\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\\r\\n...You can search for images available on Docker Hub by using thedockercommand with thesearchsubcommand. For example, to search for the Ubuntu image, type:docker search ubuntuThe script will crawl Docker Hub and return a listing of all images whose name match the search string. In this case, the output will be similar to this:OutputNAME                              DESCRIPTION                                     STARS     OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED\\r\\nubuntu                            Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating s...   3808      [OK]       \\r\\nubuntu-upstart                    Upstart is an event-based replacement for ...   61        [OK]       \\r\\ntorusware/speedus-ubuntu          Always updated official Ubuntu docker imag...   25                   [OK]\\r\\nrastasheep/ubuntu-sshd            Dockerized SSH service, built on top of of...   24                   [OK]\\r\\nubuntu-debootstrap                debootstrap --variant=minbase --components...   23        [OK]       \\r\\nnickistre/ubuntu-lamp             LAMP server on Ubuntu                           6                    [OK]\\r\\nnickistre/ubuntu-lamp-wordpress   LAMP on Ubuntu with wp-cli installed            5                    [OK]\\r\\nnuagebec/ubuntu                   Simple always updated Ubuntu docker images...   4                    [OK]\\r\\nnimmis/ubuntu                     This is a docker images different LTS vers...   4                    [OK]\\r\\nmaxexcloo/ubuntu                  Docker base image built on Ubuntu with Sup...   2                    [OK]\\r\\nadmiringworm/ubuntu               Base ubuntu images based on the official u...   1                    [OK]\\r\\n\\r\\n...In theOFFICIALcolumn,OKindicates an image built and supported by the company behind the project. Once you\\'ve identified the image that you would like to use, you can download it to your computer using thepullsubcommand, like so:docker pull ubuntuAfter an image has been downloaded, you may then run a container using the downloaded image with therunsubcommand. If an image has not been downloaded whendockeris executed with therunsubcommand, the Docker client will first download the image, then run a container using it:docker run ubuntuTo see the images that have been downloaded to your computer, type:docker imagesThe output should look similar to the following:OutputREPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\\r\\nubuntu              latest              c5f1cf30c96b        7 days ago          120.8 MB\\r\\nhello-world         latest              94df4f0ce8a4        2 weeks ago         967 BAs you\\'ll see later in this tutorial, images that you use to run containers can be modified and used to generate new images, which may then be uploaded (pushedis the technical term) to Docker Hub or other Docker registries.Step 5 — Running a Docker ContainerThehello-worldcontainer you ran in the previous is an example of a container that runs and exits, after emitting a test message. Containers, however, can be much more useful than that, and they can be interactive. After all, they are similar to virtual machines, only more resource-friendly.As an example, let\\'s run a container using the latest image of Ubuntu. The combination of the-iand-tswitches gives you interactive shell access into the container:docker run -it ubuntuYour command prompt should change to reflect the fact that you\\'re now working inside the container and should take this form:Outputroot@d9b100f2f636:/#Important:Note the container id in the command prompt. In the above example, it isd9b100f2f636.Now you may run any command inside the container. For example, let\\'s update the package database inside the container. No need to prefix any command withsudo, because you\\'re operating inside the container with root privileges:apt-get updateThen install any application in it. Let\\'s install NodeJS, for example.apt-get install -y nodejsStep 6 — Committing Changes in a Container to a Docker ImageWhen you start up a Docker image, you can create, modify, and delete files just like you can with a virtual machine. The changes that you make will only apply to that container. You can start and stop it, but once you destroy it with thedocker rmcommand, the changes will be lost for good.This section shows you how to save the state of a container as a new Docker image.After installing nodejs inside the Ubuntu container, you now have a container running off an image, but the container is different from the image you used to create it.To save the state of the container as a new image, first exit from it:exitThen commit the changes to a new Docker image instance using the following command. The-mswitch is for the commit message that helps you and others know what changes you made, while-ais used to specify the author. The container ID is the one you noted earlier in the tutorial when you started the interactive docker session. Unless you created additional repositories on Docker Hub, the repository is usually your Docker Hub username:docker commit -m \"What did you do to the image\" -a \"Author Name\"container-idrepository/new_image_nameFor example:<ul class=\"prefixed\" sty'),\n",

For a detailed introduction to the different components of a Docker container, check outThe Docker Ecosystem: An Introduction to Common Components.There are two methods for installing Docker on Ubuntu 16.04. One method involves installing it on an existing installation of the operating system. The other involves spinning up a server with a tool calledDocker Machinethat auto-installs Docker on it.In this tutorial, you\\'ll learn how to install and use it on an existing installation of Ubuntu 16.04.PrerequisitesTo follow this tutorial, you will need the following:64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 serverNon-root user with sudo privilegesInitial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to set this up.)Note:Docker requires a 64-bit version of Ubuntu as well as a kernel version equal to or greater than 3.10. The default 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 server meets these requirements.All the commands in this tutorial should be run as a non-root user. If root access is required for the command, it will be preceded bysudo.Initial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to add users and give them sudo access.Step 1 — Installing DockerThe Docker installation package available in the official Ubuntu 16.04 repository may not be the latest version. To get the latest and greatest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository. This section shows you how to do just that.First, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -Add the Docker repository to APT sources:sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\"Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:sudo apt-get updateMake sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:apt-cache policy docker-ceYou should see output similar to the follow:Output of apt-cache policy docker-cedocker-ce:\\r\\n  Installed: (none)\\r\\n  Candidate: 17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial\\r\\n  Version table:\\r\\n     17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\\r\\n        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages\\r\\n     17.03.0~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\\r\\n        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 PackagesNotice thatdocker-ceis not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 16.04. Thedocker-ceversion number might be different.Finally, install Docker:sudo apt-get install -y docker-ceDocker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it\\'s running:sudo systemctl status dockerThe output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:Output● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine\\r\\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\\r\\n   Active:active (running)since Sun 2016-05-01 06:53:52 CDT; 1 weeks 3 days ago\\r\\n     Docs: https://docs.docker.com\\r\\n Main PID: 749 (docker)Installing Docker now gives you not just the Docker service (daemon) but also thedockercommand line utility, or the Docker client. We\\'ll explore how to use thedockercommand later in this tutorial.Step 2 — Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo (Optional)By default, running thedockercommand requires root privileges — that is, you have to prefix the command withsudo. It can also be run by a user in thedockergroup, which is automatically created during the installation of Docker. If you attempt to run thedockercommand without prefixing it withsudoor without being in the docker group, you\\'ll get an output like this:Outputdocker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?.\\r\\nSee \\'docker run --help\\'.If you want to avoid typingsudowhenever you run thedockercommand, add your username to thedockergroup:sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}To apply the new group membership, you can log out of the server and back in, or you can type the following:su - ${USER}You will be prompted to enter your user\\'s password to continue. Afterwards, you can confirm that your user is now added to thedockergroup by typing:id -nGOutputsammysudo dockerIf you need to add a user to thedockergroup that you\\'re not logged in as, declare that username explicitly using:sudo usermod -aG dockerusernameThe rest of this article assumes you are running thedockercommand as a user in the docker user group. If you choose not to, please prepend the commands withsudo.Step 3 — Using the Docker CommandWith Docker installed and working, now\\'s the time to become familiar with the command line utility. Usingdockerconsists of passing it a chain of options and commands followed by arguments. The syntax takes this form:docker [option] [command] [arguments]To view all available subcommands, type:dockerAs of Docker 1.11.1, the complete list of available subcommands includes:Outputattach    Attach to a running container\\r\\n    build     Build an image from a Dockerfile\\r\\n    commit    Create a new image from a container\\'s changes\\r\\n    cp        Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem\\r\\n    create    Create a new container\\r\\n    diff      Inspect changes on a container\\'s filesystem\\r\\n    events    Get real time events from the server\\r\\n    exec      Run a command in a running container\\r\\n    export    Export a container\\'s filesystem as a tar archive\\r\\n    history   Show the history of an image\\r\\n    images    List images\\r\\n    import    Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image\\r\\n    info      Display system-wide information\\r\\n    inspect   Return low-level information on a container or image\\r\\n    kill      Kill a running container\\r\\n    load      Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN\\r\\n    login     Log in to a Docker registry\\r\\n    logout    Log out from a Docker registry\\r\\n    logs      Fetch the logs of a container\\r\\n    network   Manage Docker networks\\r\\n    pause     Pause all processes within a container\\r\\n    port      List port mappings or a specific mapping for the CONTAINER\\r\\n    ps        List containers\\r\\n    pull      Pull an image or a repository from a registry\\r\\n    push      Push an image or a repository to a registry\\r\\n    rename    Rename a container\\r\\n    restart   Restart a container\\r\\n    rm        Remove one or more containers\\r\\n    rmi       Remove one or more images\\r\\n    run       Run a command in a new container\\r\\n    save      Save one or more images to a tar archive\\r\\n    search    Search the Docker Hub for images\\r\\n    start     Start one or more stopped containers\\r\\n    stats     Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics\\r\\n    stop      Stop a running container\\r\\n    tag       Tag an image into a repository\\r\\n    top       Display the running processes of a container\\r\\n    unpause   Unpause all processes within a container\\r\\n    update    Update configuration of one or more containers\\r\\n    version   Show the Docker version information\\r\\n    volume    Manage Docker volumes\\r\\n    wait      Block until a container stops, then print its exit codeTo view the switches available to a specific command, type:dockerdocker-subcommand--helpTo view system-wide information about Docker, use:docker infoStep 4 — Working with Docker ImagesDocker containers are run from Docker images. By default, it pulls these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry managed by Docker, the company behind the Docker project. Anybody can build and host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so most applications and Linux distributions you\\'ll need to run Docker containers have images that are hosted on Docker Hub.To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:docker run hello-worldThe output, which should include the following, should indicate that Docker in working correctly:OutputHello from Docker.\\r\\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\\r\\n...You can search for images available on Docker Hub by using thedockercommand with thesearchsubcommand. For example, to search for the Ubuntu image, type:docker search ubuntuThe script will crawl Docker Hub and return a listing of all images whose name match the search string. In this case, the output will be similar to this:OutputNAME                              DESCRIPTION                                     STARS     OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED\\r\\nubuntu                            Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating s...   3808      [OK]       \\r\\nubuntu-upstart                    Upstart is an event-based replacement for ...   61        [OK]       \\r\\ntorusware/speedus-ubuntu          Always updated official Ubuntu docker imag...   25                   [OK]\\r\\nrastasheep/ubuntu-sshd            Dockerized SSH service, built on top of of...   24                   [OK]\\r\\nubuntu-debootstrap                debootstrap --variant=minbase --components...   23        [OK]       \\r\\nnickistre/ubuntu-lamp             LAMP server on Ubuntu                           6                    [OK]\\r\\nnickistre/ubuntu-lamp-wordpress   LAMP on Ubuntu with wp-cli installed            5                    [OK]\\r\\nnuagebec/ubuntu                   Simple always updated Ubuntu docker images...   4                    [OK]\\r\\nnimmis/ubuntu                     This is a docker images different LTS vers...   4                    [OK]\\r\\nmaxexcloo/ubuntu                  Docker base image built on Ubuntu with Sup...   2                    [OK]\\r\\nadmiringworm/ubuntu               Base ubuntu images based on the official u...   1                    [OK]\\r\\n\\r\\n...In theOFFICIALcolumn,OKindicates an image built and supported by the company behind the project. Once you\\'ve identified the image that you would like to use, you can download it to your computer using thepullsubcommand, like so:docker pull ubuntuAfter an image has been downloaded, you may then run a container using the downloaded image with therunsubcommand. If an image has not been downloaded whendockeris executed with therunsubcommand, the Docker client will first download the image, then run a container using it:docker run ubuntuTo see the images that have been downloaded to your computer, type:docker imagesThe output should look similar to the following:OutputREPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\\r\\nubuntu              latest              c5f1cf30c96b        7 days ago          120.8 MB\\r\\nhello-world         latest              94df4f0ce8a4        2 weeks ago         967 BAs you\\'ll see later in this tutorial, images that you use to run containers can be modified and used to generate new images, which may then be uploaded (pushedis the technical term) to Docker Hub or other Docker registries.Step 5 — Running a Docker ContainerThehello-worldcontainer you ran in the previous is an example of a container that runs and exits, after emitting a test message. Containers, however, can be much more useful than that, and they can be interactive. After all, they are similar to virtual machines, only more resource-friendly.As an example, let\\'s run a container using the latest image of Ubuntu. The combination of the-iand-tswitches gives you interactive shell access into the container:docker run -it ubuntuYour command prompt should change to reflect the fact that you\\'re now working inside the container and should take this form:Outputroot@d9b100f2f636:/#Important:Note the container id in the command prompt. In the above example, it isd9b100f2f636.Now you may run any command inside the container. For example, let\\'s update the package database inside the container. No need to prefix any command withsudo, because you\\'re operating inside the container with root privileges:apt-get updateThen install any application in it. Let\\'s install NodeJS, for example.apt-get install -y nodejsStep 6 — Committing Changes in a Container to a Docker ImageWhen you start up a Docker image, you can create, modify, and delete files just like you can with a virtual machine. The changes that you make will only apply to that container. You can start and stop it, but once you destroy it with thedocker rmcommand, the changes will be lost for good.This section shows you how to save the state of a container as a new Docker image.After installing nodejs inside the Ubuntu container, you now have a container running off an image, but the container is different from the image you used to create it.To save the state of the container as a new image, first exit from it:exitThen commit the changes to a new Docker image instance using the following command. The-mswitch is for the commit message that helps you and others know what changes you made, while-ais used to specify the author. The container ID is the one you noted earlier in the tutorial when you started the interactive docker session. Unless you created additional repositories on Docker Hub, the repository is usually your Docker Hub username:docker commit -m \"What did you do to the image\" -a \"Author Name\"container-idrepository/new_image_nameFor example:<ul class=\"prefixed\" sty'),\n",

An example is provided below:If you own 192.168.125.0/24, and you need to add all of the IP's in that range, we can add it like the following:Create a file '' based on which ethernet card you are using.vi the following lines in the file:IPADDR_START=192.168.125.3IPADDR_END=192.168.125.254NETMASK=255.255.255.255CLONENUM_START=1Here you need to replace the start IP and end IP based on what you own.If you needed to add first 100 IP's only, you can set the first IP as192.168.125.3 and end IP as192.168.125.102. But make sure that any IP's in between these are not used somewhere else.3. Once the configuration is added you can restart the network service or reboot the server. It is better to have IPMI access before doing such changes.You can watch the video tutorial for the same by clickinghere.\",\n",

              "  'content': 'It is very important to keep the server secure from hacking and all kind of unauthorized access. So it is always important to take some time to do these basic steps to secure a Linux server:SSH securitySSH is a widely used secure platform to access the server via terminal. We can take a few measures to secure the SSH configuration.Disable Direct Root Login - It is better to disable the direct root access and permit sudo access to a specific list of users only. It can be configured on ssh configuration file. Also good to use a different SSH port instead of 22.# vi the port to a different one:Port 5613The port might be needed to open in the firewall as well:Centos 6:# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5613 ACCEPTCentos 7:# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanentClick hereto view the video tutorial for the same.Then change the root login settings:PermitRootLogin noAllowUsers #service sshd restartEnable IPTABLES or CSF firewall:It is always advised to block the unwanted ports, IP addresses, etc. using a firewall. If you are familiar with IPTABLES commands, it will be available with most of the OS by default. If you need more custom firewall setup, it is better to set up something like CSF.Keep the packages and kernel updated:It is better to set up auto updates with yum using yum-cron to make sure the packages and kernel are up to date. If auto updates are not configured, do yum update or apt-get update commands in a specific time period to make sure that the server is using the latest packages with security updates.Using secure passwords:Most of the people use some easy to remember passwords of their servers, email accounts, etc. and which make things easier for the hackers as well. It is always advised to use some complex passwords for SSH access, email accounts, and all server related logins.No empty passwords:We can check if any accounts are opened with empty passwords by running the following command:# cat | awk -F: \\'($2==\"\"){print $1}\\'Review logs:We can keep checking on the important logs to make sure no unusual things are happening without our knowledge. Here are some of the important log file locations:# - The current system activities are showing here.# - Mail server related logs.# - Authentication related logs.# - Cronjobs related logs.# - Logs related to the authentications.# - yum logsKeeping Backups:It is always good to keep the backup of your important file, folders, and databases on a different space such as Cloud or local machine, etc. You can use some kind of auto backup options to configure doing this automatically and set the destination as per your convenience.Enable login notifications:It is good to enable some login notifications to get an email when a user has accessed the server via SSH. You can set the following under .bashrc file of the specific user. So if we are setting for root:# vi \\'ALERT - Root Shell Access (ServerName) on:\\' `date` `who` | mail -s \"Alert: Root Access from `who | cut -d\\'(\\' -f2 | cut -d\\')\\' -f1`\"[email protected]',\n",
