For a detailed introduction to the different components of a Docker container, check outThe Docker Ecosystem: An Introduction to Common Components.There are two methods for installing Docker on Ubuntu 16.04. One method involves installing it on an existing installation of the operating system. The other involves spinning up a server with a tool calledDocker Machinethat auto-installs Docker on it.In this tutorial, you'll learn how to install and use it on an existing installation of Ubuntu 16.04.PrerequisitesTo follow this tutorial, you will need the following:64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 serverNon-root user with sudo privilegesInitial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to set this up.)Note:Docker requires a 64-bit version of Ubuntu as well as a kernel version equal to or greater than 3.10. The default 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 server meets these requirements.All the commands in this tutorial should be run as a non-root user. If root access is required for the command, it will be preceded bysudo.Initial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to add users and give them sudo access.Step 1 — Installing DockerThe Docker installation package available in the official Ubuntu 16.04 repository may not be the latest version. To get the latest and greatest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository. This section shows you how to do just that.First, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -Add the Docker repository to APT sources:sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\"Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:sudo apt-get updateMake sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:apt-cache policy docker-ceYou should see output similar to the follow:Output of apt-cache policy docker-cedocker-ce:\n","  Installed: (none)\n","  Candidate: 17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial\n","  Version table:\n","     17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\n","        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages\n","     17.03.0~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\n","        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 PackagesNotice thatdocker-ceis not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 16.04. Thedocker-ceversion number might be different.Finally, install Docker:sudo apt-get install -y docker-ceDocker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it's running:sudo systemctl status dockerThe output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:Output● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine\n","   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n","   Active:active (running)since Sun 2016-05-01 06:53:52 CDT; 1 weeks 3 days ago\n","     Docs: https://docs.docker.com\n"," Main PID: 749 (docker)Installing Docker now gives you not just the Docker service (daemon) but also thedockercommand line utility, or the Docker client. We'll explore how to use thedockercommand later in this tutorial.Step 2 — Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo (Optional)By default, running thedockercommand requires root privileges — that is, you have to prefix the command withsudo. It can also be run by a user in thedockergroup, which is automatically created during the installation of Docker. If you attempt to run thedockercommand without prefixing it withsudoor without being in the docker group, you'll get an output like this:Outputdocker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?.\n","See 'docker run --help'.If you want to avoid typingsudowhenever you run thedockercommand, add your username to thedockergroup:sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}To apply the new group membership, you can log out of the server and back in, or you can type the following:su - ${USER}You will be prompted to enter your user's password to continue. Afterwards, you can confirm that your user is now added to thedockergroup by typing:id -nGOutputsammysudo dockerIf you need to add a user to thedockergroup that you're not logged in as, declare that username explicitly using:sudo usermod -aG dockerusernameThe rest of this article assumes you are running thedockercommand as a user in the docker user group. If you choose not to, please prepend the commands withsudo.Step 3 — Using the Docker CommandWith Docker installed and working, now's the time to become familiar with the command line utility. Usingdockerconsists of passing it a chain of options and commands followed by arguments. The syntax takes this form:docker [option] [command] [arguments]To view all available subcommands, type:dockerAs of Docker 1.11.1, the complete list of available subcommands includes:Outputattach    Attach to a running container\n","    build     Build an image from a Dockerfile\n","    commit    Create a new image from a container's changes\n","    cp        Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem\n","    create    Create a new container\n","    diff      Inspect changes on a container's filesystem\n","    events    Get real time events from the server\n","    exec      Run a command in a running container\n","    export    Export a container's filesystem as a tar archive\n","    history   Show the history of an image\n","    images    List images\n","    import    Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image\n","    info      Display system-wide information\n","    inspect   Return low-level information on a container or image\n","    kill      Kill a running container\n","    load      Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN\n","    login     Log in to a Docker registry\n","    logout    Log out from a Docker registry\n","    logs      Fetch the logs of a container\n","    network   Manage Docker networks\n","    pause     Pause all processes within a container\n","    port      List port mappings or a specific mapping for the CONTAINER\n","    ps        List containers\n","    pull      Pull an image or a repository from a registry\n","    push      Push an image or a repository to a registry\n","    rename    Rename a container\n","    restart   Restart a container\n","    rm        Remove one or more containers\n","    rmi       Remove one or more images\n","    run       Run a command in a new container\n","    save      Save one or more images to a tar archive\n","    search    Search the Docker Hub for images\n","    start     Start one or more stopped containers\n","    stats     Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics\n","    stop      Stop a running container\n","    tag       Tag an image into a repository\n","    top       Display the running processes of a container\n","    unpause   Unpause all processes within a container\n","    update    Update configuration of one or more containers\n","    version   Show the Docker version information\n","    volume    Manage Docker volumes\n","    wait      Block until a container stops, then print its exit codeTo view the switches available to a specific command, type:dockerdocker-subcommand--helpTo view system-wide information about Docker, use:docker infoStep 4 — Working with Docker ImagesDocker containers are run from Docker images. By default, it pulls these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry managed by Docker, the company behind the Docker project. Anybody can build and host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so most applications and Linux distributions you'll need to run Docker containers have images that are hosted on Docker Hub.To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:docker run hello-worldThe output, which should include the following, should indicate that Docker in working correctly:OutputHello from Docker.\n","This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n","...You can search for images available on Docker Hub by using thedockercommand with thesearchsubcommand. For example, to search for the Ubuntu image, type:docker search ubuntuThe script will crawl Docker Hub and return a listing of all images whose name match the search string.

If an image has not been downloaded whendockeris executed with therunsubcommand, the Docker client will first download the image, then run a container using it:docker run ubuntuTo see the images that have been downloaded to your computer, type:docker imagesThe output should look similar to the following:OutputREPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\n","ubuntu              latest              c5f1cf30c96b        7 days ago          120.8 MB\n","hello-world         latest              94df4f0ce8a4        2 weeks ago         967 BAs you'll see later in this tutorial, images that you use to run containers can be modified and used to generate new images, which may then be uploaded (pushedis the technical term) to Docker Hub or other Docker registries.Step 5 — Running a Docker ContainerThehello-worldcontainer you ran in the previous is an example of a container that runs and exits, after emitting a test message. Containers, however, can be much more useful than that, and they can be interactive. After all, they are similar to virtual machines, only more resource-friendly.As an example, let's run a container using the latest image of Ubuntu. The combination of the-iand-tswitches gives you interactive shell access into the container:docker run -it ubuntuYour command prompt should change to reflect the fact that you're now working inside the container and should take this form:Outputroot@d9b100f2f636:/#Important:Note the container id in the command prompt. In the above example, it isd9b100f2f636.Now you may run any command inside the container. For example, let's update the package database inside the container. No need to prefix any command withsudo, because you're operating inside the container with root privileges:apt-get updateThen install any application in it. Let's install NodeJS, for example.apt-get install -y nodejsStep 6 — Committing Changes in a Container to a Docker ImageWhen you start up a Docker image, you can create, modify, and delete files just like you can with a virtual machine. The changes that you make will only apply to that container. You can start and stop it, but once you destroy it with thedocker rmcommand, the changes will be lost for good.This section shows you how to save the state of a container as a new Docker image.After installing nodejs inside the Ubuntu container, you now have a container running off an image, but the container is different from the image you used to create it.To save the state of the container as a new image, first exit from it:exitThen commit the changes to a new Docker image instance using the following command. The-mswitch is for the commit message that helps you and others know what changes you made, while-ais used to specify the author. The container ID is the one you noted earlier in the tutorial when you started the interactive docker session. Unless you created additional repositories on Docker Hub, the repository is usually your Docker Hub username:docker commit -m \"What did you do to the image\" -a \"Author Name\"container-idrepository/new_image_nameFor example:<ul class=\"prefixed\" sty' metadata={'title': 'How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 16.04', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/163/-How-To-Install-and-Use-Docker-on-Ubuntu-16.04.html'}\n","page_content='Let's Encrypt is a widely used free SSL certificate provider that can be integrated with most of the hosting control panels.

We can take a few measures to secure the SSH configuration.Disable Direct Root Login - It is better to disable the direct root access and permit sudo access to a specific list of users only. It can be configured on ssh configuration file. Also good to use a different SSH port instead of 22.# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_configChange the port to a different one:Port 5613The port might be needed to open in the firewall as well:Centos 6:# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5613 ACCEPTCentos 7:# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanentClick hereto view the video tutorial for the same.Then change the root login settings:PermitRootLogin noAllowUsers <your own username>#service sshd restartEnable IPTABLES or CSF firewall:It is always advised to block the unwanted ports, IP addresses, etc. using a firewall. If you are familiar with IPTABLES commands, it will be available with most of the OS by default. If you need more custom firewall setup, it is better to set up something like CSF.Keep the packages and kernel updated:It is better to set up auto updates with yum using yum-cron to make sure the packages and kernel are up to date. If auto updates are not configured, do yum update or apt-get update commands in a specific time period to make sure that the server is using the latest packages with security updates.Using secure passwords:Most of the people use some easy to remember passwords of their servers, email accounts, etc. and which make things easier for the hackers as well. It is always advised to use some complex passwords for SSH access, email accounts, and all server related logins.No empty passwords:We can check if any accounts are opened with empty passwords by running the following command:# cat /etc/shadow | awk -F: '($2==\"\"){print $1}'Review logs:We can keep checking on the important logs to make sure no unusual things are happening without our knowledge. Here are some of the important log file locations:# /var/log/messages - The current system activities are showing here.# /var/log/maillog - Mail server related logs.# /var/log/auth.log - Authentication related logs.# /var/log/cron.log - Cronjobs related logs.# /var/log/secure - Logs related to the authentications.# /var/log/yum.log - yum logsKeeping Backups:It is always good to keep the backup of your important file, folders, and databases on a different space such as Cloud or local machine, etc. You can use some kind of auto backup options to configure doing this automatically and set the destination as per your convenience.Enable login notifications:It is good to enable some login notifications to get an email when a user has accessed the server via SSH.

So before starting with setting up mail services, you need to configure email relay. Please refer the documenthereto see how can you configure it on the mail server.If you are still facing any issue after setting up the mail relay, please check the following:1. Check whether the MX records and DNS records are correctWhen we experience an email problem, the first thing to check is the MX record. An MX record(mail exchanger record ) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System that specifies a mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a recipient's domain, and a preference value used to prioritize mail delivery if multiple mail servers are available. If the MX record is not pointed to the correct mail server, you will experience email issues especially with receiving emails. You can use any DNS checking websites where you can check whether your MX record is correct or not.2. Check whether your domain is blacklisted or notAfter correcting your DNS records, the next step is to check whether your domain is blacklisted or not. Most email providers have an anti-spam feature that essentially blacklists certain email addresses if they are deemed unwanted. How this happens is when a successful phishing attack (from an address that is forged from reliable accounts to try to recover personal information) is executed, then the email device deems the address to be spam, and proceeds to blacklist the address. So, the next step is to check whether your email address is blacklisted in any of the blacklists or at the destination domains. In order to check this, you can use any of the blacklists checking websites such as MX Toolbox.Now after checking for blacklists, if you are listed in any of the blacklists, then you may submit a request at the blacklists to whitelist your domain. In MX Toolbox, you may click the details and scroll to the bottom page, there you may find the link for submitting the request.3. Authenticate your email addressWe have discussed some ways to check blacklists, now we need to know how your domain or IP get blacklisted. Suppose, you’ve been having some trouble with Russian spambots. Your end users have been complaining about receiving email bounce notifications from addresses they’ve never seen or sent messages to. You realize that someone is clearly sending fraudulent emails from your domain. If this continues, then the recipients may block you or blacklists your domain or IP from sending emails.In order to prevent this, we should authenticate your domain .i.e, make sure that the emails are coming from the legitimate account itself. Email authentication allows ISPs to properly identify the sender of the email so it can make smarter decisions about the delivery of your mail. Authentication has become a best practice for email senders since spammers have gotten really smart about disguising malicious email under the veil of a trusted brand.One quick method to improve your email delivery rates is to incorporate SPF(Sender Policy Framework), and DKIM, domain keys identified mail, into your DNS settings. With this addition to your DNS entries, you're telling recipients that you've authorized to send emails on your behalf.An SPF record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) record that identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain. The purpose of an SPF record is to prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From addresses at your domain.DKIM is an extension of DomainKeys which uses the same style DNS records. For details see http://www.dkim.org. There are basically two types of DNS records used by DomainKeys; policy records and public key records.4. Understanding common error codes and troubleshooting steps:After checking the DNS records, then the next step is to analyze and understand the error message or bounce back message received while trying to send the emails. The easiest way to resolve an email issue is to analyze the bounce back received. It actually contains the information why your email was rejected.After getting the bounce back message, look for the error code. An error code will be a 3 digit number. In an email issue, this error has huge importance and each conveys a particular information. The first one defines whether the server has accepted the command, fulfilled an action, run into a temporary issue, encountered an error etc; the second and the third one refine the description further, stating if there's been a syntactic problem, or a connection trouble etc.Among these errors, the ones starting the 5** are the permanent errors and needs to be resolved. If you get an error starting with 5**, then this is a permanent error. The errors starting with 4** are temporary errors and can be resolved after trying after some time.Below are some of the common 5** errors and instructions on how to resolve this:500This is a syntax error: the server couldn't recognize the command. It may be caused by a bad interaction of the server with your firewall or anti-virus. Read carefully their instructions to solve it. In this, the error usually includes a link which describes the error and ways to resolve this.501Most of the times, it's due to an invalid email address, but it can also be associated with connection problems (and again, an issue concerning your antivirus settings).502The command has not been activated yet on your own server. Contact your provider to know more about it.503In case of \"bad sequence\", the server has pulled off its commands in a wrong order, usually because of a broken connection. If an authentication is needed, you should enter your username and password.510/511One of the addresses in your TO, CC or BBC line doesn't exist. Check again your recipients' accounts and correct any possible misspelling.512Check again all your recipients' addresses: there will likely be an error in a domain name (like[email protected]instead of[email protected]).513Double check your recipients' addresses and correct any mistake. If everything's ok and the error persists, then it's caused by a configuration issue (simply, the server needs an authentication).523Re-send your message splitting the list in smaller subsets.530Configure your settings providing a username+password authentication. If the error persists, check all your recipients' addresses and if you've been blacklisted.541Your message has been detected and labeled as spam. You must ask the recipient to whitelist you.550Though it can be returned also by the recipient's firewall (or when the incoming server is down), the great majority of errors 550 simply tell that the recipient email address doesn't exist. You should contact the recipient otherwise and get the right address.551It's a (not very clever) strategy to prevent spamming. You should contact your ISP and ask them to allow you as a certified sender.552Try to send a lighter message: that usually happens when you dispatch emails with big attachments, so check them first.553Check all the addresses in the TO, CC and BCC field. There should be an error or a misspelling somewhere.554The incoming server thinks that your email is spam, or your IP has been blacklisted. Check carefully if you ended up in some spam lists.' metadata={'title': 'Email issues :: Common Troubleshooting Steps', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/166/Email-issues--Common-Troubleshooting-Steps.html'}\n","page_content='Enable AutoSSL In CentOS Web PanelSSL Encryption Certificates are a very common method of securing your site.

It is having both free and paid versions(CWP Pro) are available. The free version can handle most of the basic hosting needs of a customer. As the name indicates, it only works with Centos operating system. The installation process is pretty straight forward and the steps are providedhere.2.Vesta PanelThe Vesta panel is more simple compared to CWP but using older versions of PHP and MySQL by default. The upgrade options are not available from the panel and the manual upgrades are causing issues with the panel most of the time. But it is a good choice for beginners as it is having all the basic options coming by default. Vesta can be installed on any operating system. You can find the installation steps by clickinghere.3.Webmin PanelWebmin is one of the popular Opensource web hosting control panels. It provides all the major web hosting-related features such as website management, FTP, DNS management, etc. Webmin can be installed on Ubuntu and Debian OS platforms. The GUI looks a bit old and tough to understand for beginners compared to the other panels. The installation steps can be foundhere.4.CyberPanelThe CyberPanel is another open-source web hosting control panel. Comparing with the other panels, the major difference is the web server using with this one. There are 2 options, either to the OpenLiteSpeed which is the opensource version of the LiteSpeed web server and also we can select the LiteSpeed Enterprise if needed.

Lowering the ‘Timeout’ value will cause a long running script to terminate earlier than expected.On virtualized servers like VPS servers, lowering this value to 100 can help improve performance.KeepAlive OnThis setting should be “On” unless the server is getting requests from hundreds of IPs at once.High volume and/or load balanced servers should have this setting disabled (Off) to increase connection throughput.MaxKeepAliveRequests 100This setting limits the number of requests allowed per persistent connection when KeepAlive is on. If it is set to 0, unlimited requests will be allowed.It is recommended to keep this value at 100 for virtualized accounts like VPS accounts. On dedicated servers it is recommended that this value be modified to 150.KeepAliveTimeout 15The number of seconds Apache will wait for another request before closing the connection. Setting this to a high value may cause performance problems in heavily loaded servers. The higher the timeout, the more server processes will be kept occupied waiting on connections with idle clients.It is recommended that this value be lowered to 5 on all servers.MinSpareServers 5This directive sets the desired minimum number of idle child server processes. An idle process is one which is not handling a request. If there are fewer spareservers idle then specified by this value, then the parent process creates new children at a maximum rate of 1 per second.

Select mod_security from the list, then proceed with the build.Once compiled and installed Please use following URL for the Mod Security rules install in Cpanel=========ConfigServer ModSecurity Control provides an easy way of monitoring which rules are being triggered on the server in real time but more importantly, you can whitelist certain rules either globally accross the entire server or on a per account/domain basis if some of the rules conflict with a particular script or functionality (e.g. FrontPage). To install CMC, run the following:rm -fv cmc.tgzwget http://www.configserver.com/free/cmc.tgztar -xzf cmc.tgzcd cmcsh install.shcd ..rm -Rfv cmc/ cmc.tgzIf you log in to WHM you will now see “ConfigServer ModSec Control” under “Plugins”. It’s important that you click on it because when it’s run the first time, it will create the file “modsec2.whitelist.conf” if it doesn’t already exist. If that file doesn’t exist then you’ll find Apache won’t start when we come to the end of this guide. Also while you’re here, click on “Disable modsecparse.pl”. This will disable the cPanel cron job that processes and empties the mod_security log, allowing you to use the log watching tool built in to CMC.As to help our VPS and Dedicated Server customers who might also be effected by this we have designed the following guide to make installing Atmoic Mod Security into cPanel with little to no fuss.Stage 1: Run the following commands at command line:mkdir /var/aslmkdir /var/asl/tmpmkdir /var/asl/datamkdir /var/asl/data/msamkdir /var/asl/data/auditmkdir /var/asl/data/suspiciouschown nobody.nobody /var/asl/data/msachown nobody.nobody /var/asl/data/auditchown nobody.nobody /var/asl/data/suspiciouschmod o-rx -R /var/asl/data/*chmod ug+rwx -R /var/asl/data/*mkdir /var/asl/updatesmkdir /var/asl/rules/mkdir /var/asl/rules/clamavmkdir /etc/asl/touch /etc/asl/whitelistcd /usr/local/src/wget http://updates.atomicorp.com/channels/r ... est.tar.gzOrwget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/305 ... %29.tar.gztar zxvf modsec-2.7-free-latest.tar.gzmkdir /usr/local/apache/conf/modsec_rules/cp modsec/* /usr/local/apache/conf/modsec_rules/These command will create the required directory’s and download the latest free version of the Atomic Mod Security rules. It will also directly install them into the location of Apache designed for cPanel and configure the permission.Stage 2: Configure cPanel to use the Mod Security RulesIn this stage, you can do everything from WHM as long as you have Mod Security already installed as part of your EasyApache build.

It is always advised to use complex passwords other than using simple ones to avoid this kind of an attack. But still the password authentication method has a possible risk of a brute-force attack using some scripts with the commonly used passwords.Why key-based authentication is more secure?The key-based authentication is using a method authentication via two cryptographically secure keys. In simple words, we are creating a key pair from our local computer and using them for the authentication process. One of the keys is a public key that needs to be added to the servers and the other one is a private key and which needs to be kept on the computer itself safely. For added security, we can encrypt the private key with a password-protection as well. The authentication works based on these pair and once the keys are matched in the server and the local machine, the authentication works and you will get SSH access. This method is considered as more secure as it contains different levels of security and the chance of a brute-force attack is avoided as well.' metadata={'title': 'How key based SSH authentication more secure than passwords', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/350/How-key-based-SSH-authentication-more-secure-than-passwords-.html'}\n","page_content='If the CSF firewall is installed on the WHM server, we can remove IPs from the blacklist from the WHM panel itself.

It makes managing files, software, and settings on a remote server easier for users who are not yet comfortable with the command line.In this guide, we will be setting up VNC on an Ubuntu 16.04 server and connecting to it securely through an SSH tunnel. The VNC server we will be using is TightVNC, a fast and lightweight remote control package. This choice will ensure that our VNC connection will be smooth and stable even on slower internet connections.PrerequisitesTo complete this tutorial, you'll need:An Ubuntu 16.04 Droplet set up via theUbuntu 16.04 initial server setup tutorial, which includes having a sudo non-root user. Note that this tutorial can be completed using any size Droplet, but a VNC built on a smaller droplet may have more limits on functionality than a larger one.A local computer with a VNC client installed that supports VNC connections over SSH tunnels. If you are using Windows, you could use TightVNC, RealVNC, or UltraVNC. Mac OS X users can use the built-in Screen Sharing program, or can use a cross-platform app like RealVNC. Linux users can choose from many options:vinagre,krdc, RealVNC, TightVNC, and more.Step 1 — Installing the Desktop Environment and VNC ServerBy default, an Ubuntu 16.04 Droplet does not come with a graphical desktop environment or a VNC server installed, so we'll begin by installing those. Specifically, we will install packages for the latest Xfce desktop environment and the TightVNC package available in the official Ubuntu repository.On your server, install the Xfce and TightVNC packages.sudo apt-get updatesudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tightvncserverTo complete the VNC server's initial configuration after installation, use thevncservercommand to set up a secure password.vncserverYou'll be prompted to enter and verify a password, and also a view-only password. Users who log in with the view-only password will not be able to control the VNC instance with their mouse or keyboard. This is a helpful option if you want to demonstrate something to other people using your VNC server, but isn't necessary.Runningvncservercompletes the installation of VNC by creating default configuration files and connection information for our server to use. With these packages installed, you are now ready to configure your VNC server.Step 2 — Configuring the VNC ServerFirst, we need to tell our VNC server what commands to perform when it starts up. These commands are located in a configuration file calledxstartupin the.vncfolder under your home directory. The startup script was created when you ran thevncserverin the previous step, but we need modify some of the commands for the Xfce desktop.When VNC is first set up, it launches a default server instance on port 5901. This port is called a display port, and is referred to by VNC as:1. VNC can launch multiple instances on other display ports, like:2,:3, etc. When working with VNC servers, remember that:Xis a display port that refers to5900+X.Because we are going to be changing how the VNC server is configured, we'll need to first stop the VNC server instance that is running on port 5901.vncserver -kill :1The output should look like this, with a different PID:OutputKilling Xtightvnc process ID 17648Before we begin configuring the newxstartupfile, let's back up the original.mv ~/.vnc/xstartup ~/.vnc/xstartup.bakNow create a newxstartupfile withnanoor your favorite text editor.nano ~/.vnc/xstartupPaste these commands into the file so that they are performed automatically whenever you start or restart the VNC server, then save and close the file.~/.vnc/xstartup#!/bin/bash\n","xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\n","startxfce4 &The first command in the file,xrdb $HOME/.Xresources, tells VNC's GUI framework to read the server user's.Xresourcesfile..Xresourcesis where a user can make changes to certain settings of the graphical desktop, like terminal colors, cursor themes, and font rendering. The second command simply tells the server to launch Xfce, which is where you will find all of the graphical software that you need to comfortably manage your server.To ensure that the VNC server will be able to use this new startup file properly, we'll need to grant executable privileges to it.sudo chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartupNow, restart the VNC server.vncserverThe server should be started with an output similar to this:OutputNew 'X' desktop is your_server_name.com:1\n","\n","Starting applications specified in /home/sammy/.vnc/xstartup\n","Log file is /home/sammy/.vnc/liniverse.com:1.logStep 3 — Testing the VNC DesktopIn this step, we'll test the connectivity of your VNC server.First, we need to create an SSH connection on your local computer that securely forwards to thelocalhostconnection for VNC. You can do this via the terminal on Linux or OS X with following command. Remember to replaceuserandserver_ip_addresswith the sudo non-root username and IP address of your server.ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -N -f -lusernameserver_ip_addressIf you are using a graphical SSH client, like PuTTY, useserver_ip_addressas the connection IP, and setlocalhost:5901as a new forwarded port in the program's SSH tunnel settings.Next, you may now use a VNC client to attempt a connection to the VNC server atlocalhost:5901. You'll be prompted to authenticate. The correct password to use is the one you set in Step 1.Once you are connected, you should see the default Xfce desktop. It should look something like this:You can access files in your home directory with the file manager or from the command line, as seen here:Step 4 — Creating a VNC Service FileNext, we'll set up the VNC server as a systemd service. This will make it possible to start, stop, and restart it as needed, like any other systemd service.First, create a new unit file called/etc/systemd/system/[email protected]using your favorite text editor:sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/[email protected]Copy and paste the following into it. Be sure to change the value ofUserand the username in the value ofPIDFILEto match your username./etc/systemd/system/[email protected][Unit]\n","Description=Start TightVNC server at startup\n","After=syslog.target network.target\n","\n","[Service]\n","Type=forking\n","User=sammyPAMName=login\n","PIDFile=/home/sammy/.vnc/%H:%i.pid\n","ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i > /dev/null 2>&1\n","ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1280x800 :%i\n","ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i\n","\n","[Install]\n","WantedBy=multi-user.targetSave and close the file.Next, make the system aware of the new unit file.sudo systemctl daemon-reloadEnable the unit file.sudo systemctl enable[email protected]The1following the@sign signifies which display number the service should appear over, in this case the default:1as was discussed above.Stop the current instance of the VNC server if it's still running.vncserver -kill :1Then start it as you would start any other systemd service.sudo systemctl start vncserver@1You can verify that it started with this command:sudo systemctl status vncserver@1If it started correctly, the output should look like this:Output[email protected]- TightVNC server on Ubuntu 16.04\n","   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/[email protected]; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)Active: active (running)since Mon 2016-04-25 03:21:34 EDT; 6s ago\n","  Process: 2924 ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\n","\n","...\n","\n"," systemd[1]: Starting TightVNC server on Ubuntu 16.04...\n"," systemd[2938]: pam_unix(login:session): session opened for user finid by (uid=0)\n"," systemd[2949]: pam_unix(login:session): session opened for user finid by (uid=0)\n"," systemd[1]: Started TightVNC server on Ubuntu 16.04.ConclusionYou should now have a secured VNC server up and running on your Ubuntu 16.04 server.

However, addon domains don’t point to your main site. They are separate web sites with their own content.In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to set up and manage addon domains in cPanel.The ability to set up addon domains is controlled by your website host. If you don’t see the “Addon Domains” link or icon, your account may not support the feature. Check with your host. Also, there may be a limit on the number of addon domains you can add to your account.To Set up an Addon DomainLog in to cPanel.In the “Domains” section, click the “addon Domains” link or icon.Enter the addon domain’s name in the “New Domain Name” text box. cPanel will automatically populate the “Subdomain” and “Document Root” text boxes.Select the “Create an FTP account associated with this addon Domain” checkbox if you want to create an FTP account specifically for the addon domain.The FTP account created here provides separate access to the addon domain website and cannot access the primary domain website files.Click the “Add Domain” button.When the addon domain name has been added, you can FTP to the “Document Root” folder (shown above) and upload your site files. Alternately you can use the cPanel File Manager to upload materials.When the addon domain website is available to visitors depends on when you changed the name servers to point to your main account name servers. DNS changes take a bit of time to propagate throughout the internet, and that period varies depending on several factors.Typically though, DNS changes shouldn’t take more than a few hours to propagate. At which point, you can access the new site.Email for an Addon domainYou canset up email accountsfor your addon domains in cPanel. The domain will be an option in the drop-down menu.How to Enable or Disable Addon Domain RedirectionIn the “Modify Addon Domain” section, click the “Manage Redirection” link corresponding to the domain you wish to manage.Enter the URL that you would like the addon domain to redirect to in the “Domain […] redirects to” field.Click the “Save” button.To Disable an Addon Domain RedirectClick the “Manage Redirection” link corresponding to the addon domain you wish to manage.In the “Disable Addon Domain Redirection” section, click the “Disable Redirection” button.Where to Upload Website Files for an Addon DomainWhen you set up an Addon domain, the system creates a directory with the same name as the domain. That is unless you specified a different directory name in the “Document Root” field during the setup.So, for example, if your new domain was ggexample.org, the directory would be /ggexample.org.All files for ggexample.org would be uploaded to/public_html/ggexample.org.How to Remove or Delete an Addon DomainIn the “Modify Addon Domain” section, click the “Remove” link for the domain you would like to remove.Click the “Remove” button.The directory that your addon domain points to will not be removed. If you no longer need the directory, you can delete it via FTP or by logging in the cPanel File Manager.Addon Domains are Separate WebsitesIt’s worth mentioning again that addon domains are different than alias domains in cPanel. An alias is an additional domain that points to your main website. So ggexample.com and the alias domain ggexample.net would lead to the same site.

We need to know the system architecture and the kernel version that is used on the system.Check the active kernel used by the system with the uname command.uname -msrYou will get the kernel version as below.Linux 4.4.0-78-generic x86_64This means, we are using the Generic Linux kernel version 4.4 with x86_64/64-bit system.The Generic kernel is a general purpose kernel. If you want to use your box for tasks like editing, encoding video and audio, it's e.g. recommended to use one of the 'lowlatency' kernels.Step 3 - Install New Kernel VersionNow we know that we are using kernel 4.4 at the moment. In this step, we will upgrade the used kernel to the latest mainline kernel build version 4.11.2. All mainline kernel build can be downloaded from this site -http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/.Create a new directory for the mainline kernel version.sudo mkdir -p ~/4.11.2cd ~/4.11.2Download the generic kernel version packages (because we are using generic version) using the wget command.wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.11.2/linux-headers-4.11.2-041102_4.11.2-041102.201705201036_all.debwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.11.2/linux-headers-4.11.2-041102-generic_4.11.2-041102.201705201036_amd64.debwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.11.2/linux-image-4.11.2-041102-generic_4.11.2-041102.201705201036_amd64.debNow install the packages with the dpkg command below.dpkg -i *.debWhen the kernel package installation is complete, update grub and reboot the system.sudo update-grubsudo rebootAfter server rebooting, check again the kernel version.uname -msrYou will get a new kernel on the system: 4.11.2.Linux 4.11.2-041102-generic x86_64Step 4 - Remove the old KernelAt this stage, the kernel version of our server is updated to 4.11.2. In this step, we will remove the old kernel and just leave the new version that we are using now.For this purpose, we will use a command-line utility named 'byobu'. It's a great utility to safely remove and purge an old kernel from the system and will never remove the currently running kernel.Install byobu with the apt command below.sudo apt install byobuWhet it's complete, check installed kernel version on the system.dpkg -l | grep linux-imageWe will get the result as below.On the server, iI have installed three versions of the Ubuntu kernel: 4.4.62 - 4.4.78 - 4.11.2.

Reading from and writing to swap is slower than using memory, but it can provide a good safety net for when your server is low on memory.Without swap, a server that runs out of memory may start killing applications to free up memory, or even crash. This can cause you to lose unsaved data or experience downtime. To ensure reliable data access, some applications require swap to function.In this guide, we will cover how to create and enable a swap file on a CentOS 7 server. You can watch the video for the same by clickinghere.PrerequisitesBefore you begin with this guide, there are a few steps that need to be completed first.You will need a CentOS 7 server installed and configured with a non-root user that hassudoprivileges. If you haven't done this yet, you can run through steps 1-4 in theCentOS 7 initial server setup guideto create this account.Once you have your non-root user, you can use it to SSH into your CentOS server and continue with the installation of your swap file.Check the System for Swap InformationBefore we begin, we should take a look at our server's storage to see if we already have some swap space available. While we can have multiple swap files or swap partitions, one should generally be enough.We can see if the system has any configured swap by usingswapon, a general-purpose swap utility. With the-sflag,swaponwill display a summary of swap usage and availability on our storage device:swapon -sIf nothing is returned by the command, then the summary was empty and no swap file exists.Another way of checking for swap space is with thefreeutility, which shows us the system's overall memory usage. We can see our current memory and swap usage (in megabytes) by typing:free -mtotal       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n","Mem:          3953        315       3637          8         11        107\n","-/+ buffers/cache:        196       3756Swap:            00       4095As you can see, our total swap space in the system is 0. This matches what we saw withswapon.Check Available Storage SpaceThe typical way of allocating space for swap is to use a separate partition that is dedicated to the task. However, altering the partition scheme is not always possible due to hardware or software constraints. Fortunately, we can just as easily create a swap file that resides on an existing partition.Before we do this, we should be aware of our current drive usage. We can get this information by typing:df -hFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on/dev/vda1        59G  1.5G   55G   3% /devtmpfs        2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev\n","tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm\n","tmpfs           2.0G  8.3M  2.0G   1% /run\n","tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /sys/fs/cgroupNote:the-hflag simply tellsdhto output drive information in a human-friendly reading format. For example, instead of outputting the raw number of memory blocks in a partition,df -hwill tell us the space usage and availability in M (for megabytes) or G (for gigabytes).As you can see on the first line, our storage partition has 59 gigabytes available, so we have quite a bit of space to work with. Keep in mind that this is on a fresh, medium-sized VPS instance, so your actual usage might be very different.Although there are many opinions about the appropriate size of a swap space, it really depends on your application requirements and your personal preferences. Generally, an amount equal to or double the amount of memory on your system is a good starting point.Since my system has 4 gigabytes of memory, and doubling that would take a larger chunk from my storage space than I am willing to part with, I will create a swap space of 4 gigabytes to match my system's memory.Create a Swap FileNow that we know our available storage space, we can go about creating a swap file within our filesystem. We will create a file calledswapfilein our root (/) directory, though you can name the file something else if you prefer. The file must allocate the amount of space that we want for our swap file.The fastest and easiest way to create a swap file is by usingfallocate. This command creates a file of a preallocated size instantly. We can create a 4 gigabyte file by typing:sudo fallocate -l4G/swapfileAfter entering your password to authorizesudoprivileges, the swap file will be created almost instantly, and the prompt will be returned to you. We can verify that the correct amount of space was reserved for swap by usingls:ls -lh/swapfile-rw-r--r-- 1 root root4.0GOct 30 11:00/swapfileAs you can see, our swap file was created with the correct amount of space set aside.Enable a Swap FileRight now, our file is created, but our system does not know that this is supposed to be used for swap. We need to tell our system to format this file as swap and then enable it.Before we do that, we should adjust the permissions on our swap file so that it isn't readable by anyone besides the root account. Allowing other users to read or write to this file would be a huge security risk. We can lock down the permissions withchmod:sudo chmod 600/swapfileThis will restrict both read and write permissions to the root account only. We can verify that the swap file has the correct permissions by usingls -lhagain:ls -lh/swapfile-rw------- 1 root root4.0GOct 30 11:00/swapfileNow that our swap file is more secure, we can tell our system to set up the swap space for use by typing:sudo mkswap/swapfileSetting up swapspace version 1, size =4194300KiB\n","no label, UUID=b99230bb-21af-47bc-8c37-de41129c39bfOur swap file is now ready to be used as a swap space. We can begin using it by typing:sudo swapon/swapfileTo verify that the procedure was successful, we can check whether our system reports swap space now:swapon -sFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority/swapfilefile41943000     -1This output confirms that we have a new swap file. We can use thefreeutility again to corroborate our findings:free -mtotal       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n","Mem:          3953        315       3637          8         11        107\n","-/+ buffers/cache:        196       3756Swap:         40950       4095Our swap has been set up successfully, and our operating system will begin to use it as needed.Make the Swap File PermanentOur swap file is enabled at the moment, but when we reboot, the server will not automatically enable the file for use. We can change that by modifying thefstabfile, which is a table that manages filesystems and partitions.Edit the file withsudoprivileges in your text editor:sudo nano /etc/fstabAt the bottom of the file, you need to add a line that will tell the operating system to automatically use the swap file that you created:/swapfileswap    swap    sw  0   0When you are finished adding the line, you can save and close the file. The server will check this file on each bootup, so the swap file will be ready for use from now on.Tweak Your Swap Settings (Optional)There are a few options that you can configure that will have an impact on your system's performance when dealing with swap. These configurations are optional in most cases, and the changes that you make will depend on your application needs and your personal preference.SwappinessTheswappinessparameter determines how often your system swaps data out of memory to the swap space. This is a value between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of memory usage that will trigger the use of swap.With values close to zero, the system will not swap data to the drive unless absolutely necessary. Remember, interactions with the swap file are \"expensive\" in that they are a lot slower than interactions with memory, and this difference in read and write speed can cause a significant reduction in an application's performance. Telling the system not to rely on the swap as much will generally make your system faster.Values that are closer to 100 will try to put more data into swap in an effort to keep more memory free. Depending on your applications' memory profile, or what you are using your server for, this might be the better choice in some cases.We can see the current swappiness value by reading theswappinessconfiguration file:cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness30CentOS 7 defaults to a swappiness setting of 30, which is a fair middle ground for most desktops and local servers. For a VPS system, we'd probably want to move it closer to 0.We can set the swappiness to a different value by using thesysctlcommand. For instance, to set the swappiness to 10, we could type:sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10vm.swappiness =10This setting will persist until the next reboot. To make the setting persist between reboots, we can add the outputted line to oursysctlconfiguration file:sudo nano /etc/sysctl.confAdd your swappiness setting to the bottom of the file:vm.swappiness =10When you are finished adding the line, you can save and close the file. The server will now automatically set the swappiness to the value you declared on each bootup.Cache PressureAnother related value that you might want to modify is thevfs_cache_pressure. This setting affects the storage of special filesystem metadata entries. Constantly reading and refreshing this information is generally very costly, so storing it on the cache for longer is excellent for your system's performance.You can see the current value of this cache pressure by querying theprocfilesystem again:cat /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure100As it is currently configured, our system removes inode information from the cache far too quickly. We can set this to a more conservative setting, like 50, by usingsysctl:sudo sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50vm.vfs_cache_pressure =50Again, this is only valid for our current session. We can change that by adding it to our configuration file, like we did with our swappiness setting:sudo nano /etc/sysctl.confAt the bottom, add the line that specifies your new value:vm.vfs_cache_pressure =50When you are finished adding the line, you can save and close the file. The server will now automatically set the cache pressure to the value you declared on each bootup.ConclusionBy following the steps in this guide, you will have given your server some breathing room in terms of memory usage. Swap space is incredibly useful in avoiding some common problems.If you are running into OOM (out of memory) errors, or if you find that your system is unable to use the applications that you need, the best solution is to optimize your application configurations or upgrade your server. However, configuring swap space can give you more flexibility and can help buy you time on a less powerful server.' metadata={'title': 'How to add swap on Centos 7', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/168/How-to-add-swap-on-Centos-7.html'}\n","page_content='We can make restrictions for the server access based on countries using unique country codes via the CSF interface in WHM.

If it is not installed, you can simply do it with the yum or apt-get command based on the OS you are using.Custom port setup instead of the default port 22As a part of increasing the security, the SSH port can be changed from 22 to any different one based on your choice. The connection refused error can be shown if you are trying to access with the wrong port. You can verify it from the backend if you have console access or VNC access is available. If it is a dedicated server, you may need to check it via IPMI. If you are using a WHM server and the root password is available, you may check it from the WHM terminal or reset it using some simple tricks as explainedhere.Firewall blocking the portAnother possible issue is a firewall-related block for the port you are trying. Here, the solution is to add the port to the firewall whitelist. If you are using CSF in the WHM panel, you can do it via the WHM interface itself as explainedhere. If you are using iptables/ufw, the port needs to be added from the command line itself.' metadata={'title': 'How to check and resolve SSH connection refused errors', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/346/How-to-check-and-resolve-SSH-connection-refused-errors.html'}\n","page_content='You can check the bandwidth usage of your dedicated server with HostSailor from your server control panel itself.

We need to check and make sure all files inside the Wordpress directory is having 644 and folders are having 755 permission and ownership is set to the user.- Change permissions using 'chmod' command:Eg: # chmod 755 wp-admin- Change ownership using chown command:Eg: #chown jack. wp-content- If the permission or ownership needs to be changed recursively, you need to use -R option with the command:Eg: #chown -R jack. wp-contentIncorrect .htaccess file.If a lot of custom rules are set in the .htaccess file, it might be the cause of this issue.

We also recommend speaking with your networking team beforehand to ensure you are minimizing potential security risks.

There are two ways to upgrade to the latest Ubuntu version: You can use the do-release-upgrade tool, which works for both CLI and GUI instances, or the GUI update tool.In this guide, we will use the do-release-upgrade tool.To commence the upgrade, run the command:# do-release-upgrade -dDuring the upgrade, the upgrade tool will probe for the latest LTS release and walk you through a series of prompts.First and foremost, it will detect your SSH connection and notify you that an additional SSH service will be started on port 1022. Simply type “Y” to proceed.Next, the upgrade tool will notify you to open port 1022, which will be used as an alternative SSH port in case of an SSH connection interruption on the default port. Since you already opened the port, just hit ENTER.The update tool will calculate all the changes and provide a summary of the following:1.

They did so for a variety of reasons, mainly for cost. Retail, in particular, has been badly hit with shops closing and income plummeting. Their only survival option is to move to an online presence with an e-commerce platform. In many cases, cost considerations and a need to implement quickly mean that an MSP is the only option.All businesses with internal IT systems experience downtime for a variety of reasons. It’s a fact of life that the infrastructure will fail from time to time, usually at the worst possible time. MSP’s, while trying not to, do also have downtime.Downtime Types and ReasonsThe first thing to understand is that downtime is sometimes outside the MSP’scontrol. Not being able to access systems through an Internet connection does not necessarily mean that the systems are down, just that your connection to the MSPhas failed. Internet connections pass through a series of third parties, and if any link in the chain is broken, the entire chain is broken.What also needs to be understood is that there are several classes of downtime:1.Catastrophic. The entire Data Centre is inoperable, usually because of a power outage. There should be backup power arrangements, but these may only last for a limited time.2.Total. The Datacenter is up and running, and you can connect to it, but your business systems are wholly unavailable or unresponsive;3.Partial. The Datacenter is up and running, and you can connect to it, but parts of your business systems, perhaps integration with other systems, are unavailable or unresponsive;4.Irritating. You can carry on with normal business operations, but some functions are not available.Common reasons for downtime include:1.Equipment failure. Something as simple as a cooling fan in a piece of equipment failing can shut it down.2.Software failures. Some software systems automatically download and install upgrades. From time to time, they can cause the systems themselves or their integrations to fail. In very rare cases, operating systems close down.3.Malicious activities. Targeted attacks on the Data Centre and malware can cause downtime.4.Force Majeure. In some countries, government restrictions can cause DataCentres to close entirely or restrict their connectivity. For example, in Ethiopia Internet connectivity is supplied through a single source, the parastatal, Ethiotel. During civil unrest, the Government has instructed Ethiotelto, simply put, switch off the Internet and cellphone services.Avoidance Measures1.Power loss. The Data Centre has backup power arrangements. These are usually at two levels, batteries to cover for short outages, and generators for longer-term power losses. Backup planning must include a provision to refill the diesel tanks, and what to do if a generator fails.2.Equipment Failure. This is usually following an equipment failure in a critical device. It can be as simple as a cooling fan failure. Most key equipment has hot-swappable components and failure alerts, minimizing potential downtime. Using Raid can protect disk storage against a single disk unit failure. SSD units have a limited lifetime but are immune from mechanical failure.3.Malware. The FBI has recorded an upsurge in malicious activities over the last year. DDoS attacks have increased in number and viciousness, and they theorize that could be due to online merchants trying to block competitors. Other vectors like Phishing have shown similar increases, and fraudsters try to take advantage of the confusion. An MSP must have comprehensive anti-malware defenses in place and in a shared environment insulate one customer from the actions of another. Network monitoring will show up network attacks to be blocked before they cause a loss of service.4.Force Majeure. There is little you can do unless there is an alternative route to get around the issue. One technique is to have a second Data Centre in another jurisdiction as a hot-standby and route all customer traffic to that site. MSPs like HostSailor with sites in multiple countries are better positioned to offset local actions.MSPs like Host Sailor take uptime and service levels very seriously. When downtime happens, it reflects not only on the customer but also on the MSP, causing great reputational damage. They make great efforts to provide a safe and secure environment for their customers.' metadata={'title': 'Managed Hosting Provider :: Downtime Explained', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/356/Managed-Hosting-Provider--Downtime-Explained-.html'}\n","page_content='We can simply manage the MySQL databases from the cPanel interface itself.

Using the shared hosting nameservers.This is the easiest way to point a domain to the shared server. You just need to change the nameservers in your domain client area based on which shared hosting server you are using. You can identify the same from your welcome email by checking the server IP:a. hosting1.ro(Server IP: 185.141.25.242)ns1.ro.hostsailor.comns2.ro.hostsailor.comb. hosting2.ro(Server IP: 185.244.151.83)ns3.ro.hostsailor.comns4.ro.hostsailor.comc. hosting1.nl(Server IP: 194.36.191.195)ns5.nl.hostsailor.comns6.nl.hostsailor.comFurther configurations such as MX, CNAME, etc are already configured in WHM, you just have to do the above and the domain will be accessible after the DNS propagation. You can also use the email services using the webmail interface provided with the cPanel account.2. Using default nameservers provided by the domain registrar.Every domain registrar will provide default nameservers for every domain registered with them. If you need to use them, you can set it from the domain registrar control panel under 'Nameservers' section. If you have registered the domain with us, you need to use the following default nameservers:dns1.name-services.comdns2.name-services.comdns3.name-services.comdns4.name-services.comdns5.name-services.comOnce the nameservers are set, you can point the domain A recordin the DNS Management sectionto the shared server IPs which are mentioned in the above section. If you need to use email services, you need to point MX record and other records respectively.3. Using other nameservers.You can also use some CDN's or other nameservers as you wish. In case of this, you can just use those nameservers in the same section 'Nameservers' and wait for the propagation delay. But further DNS records needed to be set in the nameserver end. For example, if you are using 'Cloudflare' nameservers, the further DNS records needed to be created in the Cloudflare panel.' metadata={'title': 'Managing Shared hosting account', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/154/Managing-Shared-hosting-account.html'}\n","page_content='We can migrate accounts from one Centos Web Panel (CWP) server to another one using some integrated features in the panel.

Any VPS that uses over 20000 conntrack sessions will automatically be suspended by our automated system.A typical VPS should never use more than 10000 sessions at any given time although we do have some busy NTP servers that peak at 20000 once in a while. To check your conntrack sessions, run the following command in your VPS:cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack' metadata={'title': 'What is conntrack and checking in server', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/150/What-is-conntrack-and-checking-in-server.html'}\n","page_content='WordPress is a famous Content Management System(CMS) running with PHP and MySQL. We can setup WordPress in different ways. The most used method is by using a tool such as Softaculous and install it graphically. Here we are describing the steps to do the WordPress installation via command line with an Apache server and MySQL on a Centos 7 server. You can watch the video tutorial by clickinghere.Create a database and user to use with the WordPress.a. Login to MySQL:mysql -u root -pProvide the MySQL root password and login.b. Create a new database:CREATE DATABASE wordpress;Replace the DB name 'wordpress' with the actual name you needed.c. Create a user:CREATE USER wordpressuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';Replace the user 'wordpressuser' with actual one and provide the actual password you need to use in the place of 'password'.d. Set up the privileges:GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO wordpressuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';Replace the DB 'wordpress',user 'wordpressuser' with actual ones and provide the correct password in the place of 'password'.e. Then run the following commands:FLUSH PRIVILEGES;exitDownload and install WordPress:a. Download WordPress:wgethttp://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gzb. Extract the file:tar xzvf latest.tar.gzc. Move the WordPress files inside the extracted directory to the actual Apache home directory. If you are using any hosting control panel, the directory might be different such as /home or /var/www/ etc. based on the panel. Here I am considering the home directory as /var/www/html/cp -avr wordpress/* /var/www/html/d. Access the home directory and set the required ownership as per the control panel:cd /var/www/htmlchown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/e. Rename the configuration file and editing the DB details:mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.phpvi wp-config.phpFind the line specifying the DB name, username and DB password and replace them with the actual ones you set in the first step:define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');define('DB_USER', 'wordpressuser');define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');Replace the DB 'wordpress',user'wordpressuser' with actual ones and provide the correct password in the place of 'password'.Once done save the file.We can access it with the site URL from the browser and you will get the WordPress initial setup page and you are done.' metadata={'title': 'Wordpress installation via command line', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/199/Wordpress-installation-via-command-line.html'}\n","page_content='Make sure all is up to date before you install anything :apt-get update;apt-get upgrade;apt-get dist-upgradeThen type that commands too :apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment xfonts-100dpi xfonts-100dpi-transcoded xfonts-75dpi xfonts-75dpi-transcoded xfonts-baseapt-get install tightvncservertightvncserver :1;tightvncserver -kill :1replace the last line \"x-window-manager &\" by \"gnome-session &\" in the file ~/.vnc/xstartupthe file need to look like this :#!/bin/shxrdb $HOME/.Xresourcesxsetroot -solid greyx-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" & # x-window-manager &gnome-session &' metadata={'title': '[Debian only]Make a graphical interface on server', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/51/Debian-onlyMake-a-graphical-interface-on-server.html'}\n","page_content='You can watch the video tutorial by clickinghere.Do the following command in the order and one per one :sudo apt-get install gnome-core vnc4server(The bellow command will ask you a password)vncserver;vncserver -kill :1Then edit the config file (~/.vnc/xstartup) using nano or any other texteditor (such as vim/vi)nano ~/.vnc/xstartupAnd replaceall linesby this :#!/bin/shunset SESSION_MANAGERgnome-session --session=gnome-classic &[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresourcesxsetroot -solid greyvncconfig -iconic &the content need to be like that :Once it's done do from the same user the command (You can replace 1680x945 by your geometry screen) :vncserver -geometry 1680x945The above command start the graphical interfaceif you want to stop it, just use this command :vncserver -kill :1To know how to connect to the graphical interface, please follow this tutorial :https://clients.hostsailor.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&id=50If you want to set it as boot and save your settings like geometry etc... please check : http://superuser.com/a/421039' metadata={'title': '[Ubuntu only]Make a graphical interface on server', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/48/Ubuntu-onlyMake-a-graphical-interface-on-server.html'}\n","page_content='To connect on your RDP on windows you need to start a program called \"Remote desktop connection\" (natively on all windows)Once it is start you'll get a window like that :If you are on linux or mac, you will need a program called \"Remmina\" (natively on most of linux distros)And you'll get window like that :If you still can't access to your server on rdp, please contact our technical support.' metadata={'title': '[Windows]How to connect on RDP', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/49/WindowsHow-to-connect-on-RDP.html'}\n","page_content='There is a script available on every cPanel servers by default to enable the SPF and DKIM records via command line.  This will surely help when there is a need of adding the records for many accounts at the same time.If the SPF is only for a single account, do it like the following:# /usr/local/cpanel/bin/spf_installer $usernameReplace $username with the actual cPanel username.If the DKIM is only for a single account, do it like the following:#  /usr/local/cpanel/bin/dkim_keys_install $usernameReplace $username with the actual cPanel username.These commands will help you to enable email authentications for single cPanel users.

For a detailed introduction to the different components of a Docker container, check outThe Docker Ecosystem: An Introduction to Common Components.There are two methods for installing Docker on Ubuntu 16.04. One method involves installing it on an existing installation of the operating system. The other involves spinning up a server with a tool calledDocker Machinethat auto-installs Docker on it.In this tutorial, you\\'ll learn how to install and use it on an existing installation of Ubuntu 16.04.PrerequisitesTo follow this tutorial, you will need the following:64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 serverNon-root user with sudo privilegesInitial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to set this up.)Note:Docker requires a 64-bit version of Ubuntu as well as a kernel version equal to or greater than 3.10. The default 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 server meets these requirements.All the commands in this tutorial should be run as a non-root user. If root access is required for the command, it will be preceded bysudo.Initial Setup Guide for Ubuntu 16.04explains how to add users and give them sudo access.Step 1 — Installing DockerThe Docker installation package available in the official Ubuntu 16.04 repository may not be the latest version. To get the latest and greatest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository. This section shows you how to do just that.First, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -Add the Docker repository to APT sources:sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\"Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:sudo apt-get updateMake sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:apt-cache policy docker-ceYou should see output similar to the follow:Output of apt-cache policy docker-cedocker-ce:\\r\\n  Installed: (none)\\r\\n  Candidate: 17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial\\r\\n  Version table:\\r\\n     17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\\r\\n        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages\\r\\n     17.03.0~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial 500\\r\\n        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 PackagesNotice thatdocker-ceis not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 16.04. Thedocker-ceversion number might be different.Finally, install Docker:sudo apt-get install -y docker-ceDocker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it\\'s running:sudo systemctl status dockerThe output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:Output● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine\\r\\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\\r\\n   Active:active (running)since Sun 2016-05-01 06:53:52 CDT; 1 weeks 3 days ago\\r\\n     Docs: https://docs.docker.com\\r\\n Main PID: 749 (docker)Installing Docker now gives you not just the Docker service (daemon) but also thedockercommand line utility, or the Docker client. We\\'ll explore how to use thedockercommand later in this tutorial.Step 2 — Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo (Optional)By default, running thedockercommand requires root privileges — that is, you have to prefix the command withsudo. It can also be run by a user in thedockergroup, which is automatically created during the installation of Docker. If you attempt to run thedockercommand without prefixing it withsudoor without being in the docker group, you\\'ll get an output like this:Outputdocker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?.\\r\\nSee \\'docker run --help\\'.If you want to avoid typingsudowhenever you run thedockercommand, add your username to thedockergroup:sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}To apply the new group membership, you can log out of the server and back in, or you can type the following:su - ${USER}You will be prompted to enter your user\\'s password to continue. Afterwards, you can confirm that your user is now added to thedockergroup by typing:id -nGOutputsammysudo dockerIf you need to add a user to thedockergroup that you\\'re not logged in as, declare that username explicitly using:sudo usermod -aG dockerusernameThe rest of this article assumes you are running thedockercommand as a user in the docker user group. If you choose not to, please prepend the commands withsudo.Step 3 — Using the Docker CommandWith Docker installed and working, now\\'s the time to become familiar with the command line utility. Usingdockerconsists of passing it a chain of options and commands followed by arguments. The syntax takes this form:docker [option] [command] [arguments]To view all available subcommands, type:dockerAs of Docker 1.11.1, the complete list of available subcommands includes:Outputattach    Attach to a running container\\r\\n    build     Build an image from a Dockerfile\\r\\n    commit    Create a new image from a container\\'s changes\\r\\n    cp        Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem\\r\\n    create    Create a new container\\r\\n    diff      Inspect changes on a container\\'s filesystem\\r\\n    events    Get real time events from the server\\r\\n    exec      Run a command in a running container\\r\\n    export    Export a container\\'s filesystem as a tar archive\\r\\n    history   Show the history of an image\\r\\n    images    List images\\r\\n    import    Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image\\r\\n    info      Display system-wide information\\r\\n    inspect   Return low-level information on a container or image\\r\\n    kill      Kill a running container\\r\\n    load      Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN\\r\\n    login     Log in to a Docker registry\\r\\n    logout    Log out from a Docker registry\\r\\n    logs      Fetch the logs of a container\\r\\n    network   Manage Docker networks\\r\\n    pause     Pause all processes within a container\\r\\n    port      List port mappings or a specific mapping for the CONTAINER\\r\\n    ps        List containers\\r\\n    pull      Pull an image or a repository from a registry\\r\\n    push      Push an image or a repository to a registry\\r\\n    rename    Rename a container\\r\\n    restart   Restart a container\\r\\n    rm        Remove one or more containers\\r\\n    rmi       Remove one or more images\\r\\n    run       Run a command in a new container\\r\\n    save      Save one or more images to a tar archive\\r\\n    search    Search the Docker Hub for images\\r\\n    start     Start one or more stopped containers\\r\\n    stats     Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics\\r\\n    stop      Stop a running container\\r\\n    tag       Tag an image into a repository\\r\\n    top       Display the running processes of a container\\r\\n    unpause   Unpause all processes within a container\\r\\n    update    Update configuration of one or more containers\\r\\n    version   Show the Docker version information\\r\\n    volume    Manage Docker volumes\\r\\n    wait      Block until a container stops, then print its exit codeTo view the switches available to a specific command, type:dockerdocker-subcommand--helpTo view system-wide information about Docker, use:docker infoStep 4 — Working with Docker ImagesDocker containers are run from Docker images. By default, it pulls these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry managed by Docker, the company behind the Docker project. Anybody can build and host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so most applications and Linux distributions you\\'ll need to run Docker containers have images that are hosted on Docker Hub.To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:docker run hello-worldThe output, which should include the following, should indicate that Docker in working correctly:OutputHello from Docker.\\r\\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\\r\\n...You can search for images available on Docker Hub by using thedockercommand with thesearchsubcommand. For example, to search for the Ubuntu image, type:docker search ubuntuThe script will crawl Docker Hub and return a listing of all images whose name match the search string. In this case, the output will be similar to this:OutputNAME                              DESCRIPTION                                     STARS     OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED\\r\\nubuntu                            Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating s...   3808      [OK]       \\r\\nubuntu-upstart                    Upstart is an event-based replacement for ...   61        [OK]       \\r\\ntorusware/speedus-ubuntu          Always updated official Ubuntu docker imag...   25                   [OK]\\r\\nrastasheep/ubuntu-sshd            Dockerized SSH service, built on top of of...   24                   [OK]\\r\\nubuntu-debootstrap                debootstrap --variant=minbase --components...   23        [OK]       \\r\\nnickistre/ubuntu-lamp             LAMP server on Ubuntu                           6                    [OK]\\r\\nnickistre/ubuntu-lamp-wordpress   LAMP on Ubuntu with wp-cli installed            5                    [OK]\\r\\nnuagebec/ubuntu                   Simple always updated Ubuntu docker images...   4                    [OK]\\r\\nnimmis/ubuntu                     This is a docker images different LTS vers...   4                    [OK]\\r\\nmaxexcloo/ubuntu                  Docker base image built on Ubuntu with Sup...   2                    [OK]\\r\\nadmiringworm/ubuntu               Base ubuntu images based on the official u...   1                    [OK]\\r\\n\\r\\n...In theOFFICIALcolumn,OKindicates an image built and supported by the company behind the project. Once you\\'ve identified the image that you would like to use, you can download it to your computer using thepullsubcommand, like so:docker pull ubuntuAfter an image has been downloaded, you may then run a container using the downloaded image with therunsubcommand. If an image has not been downloaded whendockeris executed with therunsubcommand, the Docker client will first download the image, then run a container using it:docker run ubuntuTo see the images that have been downloaded to your computer, type:docker imagesThe output should look similar to the following:OutputREPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\\r\\nubuntu              latest              c5f1cf30c96b        7 days ago          120.8 MB\\r\\nhello-world         latest              94df4f0ce8a4        2 weeks ago         967 BAs you\\'ll see later in this tutorial, images that you use to run containers can be modified and used to generate new images, which may then be uploaded (pushedis the technical term) to Docker Hub or other Docker registries.Step 5 — Running a Docker ContainerThehello-worldcontainer you ran in the previous is an example of a container that runs and exits, after emitting a test message. Containers, however, can be much more useful than that, and they can be interactive. After all, they are similar to virtual machines, only more resource-friendly.As an example, let\\'s run a container using the latest image of Ubuntu. The combination of the-iand-tswitches gives you interactive shell access into the container:docker run -it ubuntuYour command prompt should change to reflect the fact that you\\'re now working inside the container and should take this form:Outputroot@d9b100f2f636:/#Important:Note the container id in the command prompt. In the above example, it isd9b100f2f636.Now you may run any command inside the container. For example, let\\'s update the package database inside the container. No need to prefix any command withsudo, because you\\'re operating inside the container with root privileges:apt-get updateThen install any application in it. Let\\'s install NodeJS, for example.apt-get install -y nodejsStep 6 — Committing Changes in a Container to a Docker ImageWhen you start up a Docker image, you can create, modify, and delete files just like you can with a virtual machine. The changes that you make will only apply to that container. You can start and stop it, but once you destroy it with thedocker rmcommand, the changes will be lost for good.This section shows you how to save the state of a container as a new Docker image.After installing nodejs inside the Ubuntu container, you now have a container running off an image, but the container is different from the image you used to create it.To save the state of the container as a new image, first exit from it:exitThen commit the changes to a new Docker image instance using the following command. The-mswitch is for the commit message that helps you and others know what changes you made, while-ais used to specify the author. The container ID is the one you noted earlier in the tutorial when you started the interactive docker session. Unless you created additional repositories on Docker Hub, the repository is usually your Docker Hub username:docker commit -m \"What did you do to the image\" -a \"Author Name\"container-idrepository/new_image_nameFor example:<ul class=\"prefixed\" sty'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': \"Activate Let's Encrypt on ISP Manager\", 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/252/Activate-Letandsharp039s-Encrypt-on-ISP-Manager.html'}, page_content=\"Let's Encrypt is a widely used free SSL certificate provider that can be integrated with most of the hosting control panels.

Also good to use a different SSH port instead of 22.# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_configChange the port to a different one:Port 5613The port might be needed to open in the firewall as well:Centos 6:# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport\\xa05613 ACCEPTCentos 7:# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanentClick hereto view the video tutorial for the same.Then change the root login settings:PermitRootLogin noAllowUsers <your own username>#service sshd restartEnable IPTABLES or CSF firewall:It is always advised to block the unwanted ports, IP addresses, etc. using a firewall. If you are familiar with IPTABLES commands, it will be available with most of the OS by default. If you need more custom firewall setup, it is better to set up something like CSF.Keep the packages and kernel updated:It is better to set up auto updates with yum using yum-cron\\xa0to make sure the packages and kernel are up to date. If auto updates are not configured, do yum update or apt-get update commands in a specific time period to make sure that the server is using the latest packages with security updates.Using secure passwords:Most of the people use some easy to remember passwords of their servers, email accounts, etc. and which make things easier for the hackers as well. It is always advised to use some complex passwords for SSH access, email accounts, and all server related logins.No empty passwords:We can check if any accounts are opened with empty passwords by running the following command:# cat /etc/shadow | awk -F: \\'($2==\"\"){print $1}\\'Review logs:We can keep checking on the important logs to make sure no unusual things are happening without our knowledge. Here are some of the important log file locations:# /var/log/messages - The current system activities are showing here.#\\xa0/var/log/maillog\\xa0- Mail server related logs.#\\xa0/var/log/auth.log - Authentication related logs.#\\xa0/var/log/cron.log - Cronjobs related logs.#\\xa0/var/log/secure - Logs related to the authentications.#\\xa0/var/log/yum.log - yum logsKeeping Backups:It is always good to keep the backup of your important file, folders, and databases on a different space such as Cloud or local machine, etc. You can use some kind of auto backup options to configure doing this automatically and set the destination as per your convenience.Enable login notifications:It is good to enable some login notifications to get an email when a user has accessed the server via SSH. You can set the following under .bashrc file of the specific user. So if we are setting for root:# vi /root/.bashrcecho \\'ALERT - Root Shell Access (ServerName) on:\\' `date` `who` | mail -s \"Alert: Root Access from `who | cut -d\\'(\\' -f2 | cut -d\\')\\' -f1`\"[email\\xa0protected]'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'Cant access my website, but others can!

So before starting with setting up mail services, you need to configure email relay. Please refer the documenthereto see how can you configure it on the mail server.If you are still facing any issue after setting up the mail relay, please check the following:1. Check whether the MX records and DNS records are correctWhen we experience an email problem, the first thing to check is the MX record. An MX record(mail exchanger record ) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System that specifies a mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a recipient\\'s domain, and a preference value used to prioritize mail delivery if multiple mail servers are available. If the MX record is not pointed to the correct mail server, you will experience email issues especially with receiving emails. You can use any DNS checking websites where you can check whether your MX record is correct or not.2. Check whether your domain is blacklisted or notAfter correcting your DNS records, the next step is to check whether your domain is blacklisted or not. Most email providers have an anti-spam feature that essentially blacklists certain email addresses if they are deemed unwanted. How this happens is when a successful phishing attack (from an address that is forged from reliable accounts to try to recover personal information) is executed, then the email device deems the address to be spam, and proceeds to blacklist the address.\\xa0So, the next step is to check whether your email address is blacklisted in any of the blacklists or at the destination domains. In order to check this, you can use any of the blacklists checking websites such as MX Toolbox.Now after checking for blacklists, if you are listed in any of the blacklists, then you may submit a request at the blacklists to whitelist your domain. In MX Toolbox, you may click the details and scroll to the bottom page, there you may find the link for submitting the request.3. Authenticate your email addressWe have discussed some ways to check blacklists, now we need to know how your domain or IP get blacklisted. Suppose, you’ve been having some trouble with Russian spambots. Your end users have been complaining about receiving email bounce notifications from addresses they’ve never seen or sent messages to. You realize that someone is clearly sending fraudulent emails from your domain. If this continues, then the recipients may block you or blacklists your domain or IP from sending emails.In order to prevent this, we should authenticate your domain .i.e, make sure that the emails are coming from the legitimate account itself. Email authentication allows ISPs to properly identify the sender of the email so it can make smarter decisions about the delivery of your mail. Authentication has become a best practice for email senders since spammers have gotten really smart about disguising malicious email under the veil of a trusted brand.One quick method to improve your email delivery rates is to incorporate SPF(Sender Policy Framework), and DKIM, domain keys identified mail, into your DNS settings. With this addition to your DNS entries, you\\'re telling recipients that you\\'ve authorized to send emails on your behalf.An SPF record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) record that identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain. The purpose of an SPF record is to prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From addresses at your domain.DKIM is an extension of DomainKeys which uses the same style DNS records. For details see http://www.dkim.org. There are basically two types of DNS records used by DomainKeys; policy records and public key records.4. Understanding common error codes and troubleshooting steps:After checking the DNS records, then the next step is to analyze and understand the error message or bounce back message received while trying to send the emails. The easiest way to resolve an email issue is to analyze the bounce back received. It actually contains the information why your email was rejected.After getting the bounce back message, look for the error code. An error code will be a 3 digit number. In an email issue, this error has huge importance and each conveys a particular information. The first one defines whether the server has accepted the command, fulfilled an action, run into a temporary issue, encountered an error etc; the second and the third one refine the description further, stating if there\\'s been a syntactic problem, or a connection trouble etc.Among these errors, the ones starting the 5** are the permanent errors and needs to be resolved. If you get an error starting with 5**, then this is a permanent error. The errors starting with 4** are temporary errors and can be resolved after trying after some time.Below are some of the common 5** errors and instructions on how to resolve this:500This is a syntax error: the server couldn\\'t recognize the command. It may be caused by a bad interaction of the server with your firewall or anti-virus. Read carefully their instructions to solve it. In this, the error usually includes a link which describes the error and ways to resolve this.501Most of the times, it\\'s due to an invalid email address, but it can also be associated with connection problems (and again, an issue concerning your antivirus settings).502The command has not been activated yet on your own server. Contact your provider to know more about it.503In case of \"bad sequence\", the server has pulled off its commands in a wrong order, usually because of a broken connection. If an authentication is needed, you should enter your username and password.510/511One of the addresses in your TO, CC or BBC line doesn\\'t exist. Check again your recipients\\' accounts and correct any possible misspelling.512Check again all your recipients\\' addresses: there will likely be an error in a domain name (like[email\\xa0protected]instead of[email\\xa0protected]).513Double check your recipients\\' addresses and correct any mistake. If everything\\'s ok and the error persists, then it\\'s caused by a configuration issue (simply, the server needs an authentication).523Re-send your message splitting the list in smaller subsets.530Configure your settings providing a username+password authentication. If the error persists, check all your recipients\\' addresses and if you\\'ve been blacklisted.541Your message has been detected and labeled as spam. You must ask the recipient to whitelist you.550Though it can be returned also by the recipient\\'s firewall (or when the incoming server is down), the great majority of errors 550 simply tell that the recipient email address doesn\\'t exist. You should contact the recipient otherwise and get the right address.551It\\'s a (not very clever) strategy to prevent spamming. You should contact your ISP and ask them to allow you as a certified sender.552Try to send a lighter message: that usually happens when you dispatch emails with big attachments, so check them first.553Check all the addresses in the TO, CC and BCC field. There should be an error or a misspelling somewhere.554The incoming server thinks that your email is spam, or your IP has been blacklisted. Check carefully if you ended up in some spam lists.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'Enable AutoSSL In CentOS Web Panel', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/293/Enable-AutoSSL-In-CentOS-Web-Panel.html'}, page_content='Enable AutoSSL In CentOS Web PanelSSL Encryption Certificates are a very common method of securing your site.

Configure Swap FileMake the swap file only accessible to root.sudochmod600 /swapfileMark the file as a swap file.sudomkswap /swapfileIf it was successful, you should see something likeSetting up swapspace version 1, size = 1024 MiB (1073737728 bytes)\\r\\nno label, UUID=801104b5-1967-458d-a564-8d63e7a24403Finally we will tell the system to start using our new swap file,sudoswapon /swapfileTo verify that the swap is now available type:sudoswapon --showResult:NAME      TYPE  SIZE USED PRIO\\r\\n/swapfile file 1024M   0B   -1We can also run the following to see our new swap file alongside physical memoryfree-hResult:total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\\r\\nMem:           488M        218M        124M         37M        145M        203M\\r\\nSwap:          1.0G          0B        1.0G3.

Secure and Optimize Apache – Tweak apache for a better performance, stability and security.[root@host /] vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.confThis list is a composite of the settings we will be reviewing from fresh install on a cPanel server:===OR AT WHM Home » Service Configuration » Apache Configuration===MinSpareServers 5MaxSpareServers 10ServerLimit 600MaxClients 600MaxRequestsPerChild 0KeepAlive OnMaxKeepAliveRequests 100KeepAliveTimeout 3Timeout 30===========Timeout 300Usually this value doesn’t require editing and a default of 300 is sufficient. Lowering the ‘Timeout’ value will cause a long running script to terminate earlier than expected.On virtualized servers like VPS servers, lowering this value to 100 can help improve performance.KeepAlive OnThis setting should be “On” unless the server is getting requests from hundreds of IPs at once.High volume and/or load balanced servers should have this setting disabled (Off) to increase connection throughput.MaxKeepAliveRequests 100This setting limits the number of requests allowed per persistent connection when KeepAlive is on. If it is set to 0, unlimited requests will be allowed.It is recommended to keep this value at 100 for virtualized accounts like VPS accounts. On dedicated servers it is recommended that this value be modified to 150.KeepAliveTimeout 15The number of seconds Apache will wait for another request before closing the connection. Setting this to a high value may cause performance problems in heavily loaded servers. The higher the timeout, the more server processes will be kept occupied waiting on connections with idle clients.It is recommended that this value be lowered to 5 on all servers.MinSpareServers 5This directive sets the desired minimum number of idle child server processes. An idle process is one which is not handling a request. If there are fewer spareservers idle then specified by this value, then the parent process creates new children at a maximum rate of 1 per second. Setting this parameter to a large number is almost always a bad idea.Liquidweb recommends adjusting the value for this setting to the following:Virtualized server, ie VPS 5Dedicated server with 1-2GB RAM 10Dedicated server with 2-4GB RAM 20Dedicated server with 4+ GB RAM 25===========11.)WHM Tweaking – Tweak WHM for better security and performance.Server Setup =>> Tweak SettingsCheck the following items...Under Domains: Prevent users from parking/adding on common internet domains.

After you select your Apache and PHP versions,you’ll be brought to the Short Options page. Select mod_security from the list, then proceed with the build.Once compiled and installed Please use following URL for the Mod Security rules install in Cpanel=========ConfigServer ModSecurity Control provides an easy way of monitoring which rules are being triggered on the server in real time but more importantly, you can whitelist certain rules either globally accross the entire server or on a per account/domain basis if some of the rules conflict with a particular script or functionality (e.g. FrontPage). To install CMC, run the following:rm -fv cmc.tgzwget http://www.configserver.com/free/cmc.tgztar -xzf cmc.tgzcd cmcsh install.shcd ..rm -Rfv cmc/ cmc.tgzIf you log in to WHM you will now see “ConfigServer ModSec Control” under “Plugins”. It’s important that you click on it because when it’s run the first time, it will create the file “modsec2.whitelist.conf” if it doesn’t already exist. If that file doesn’t exist then you’ll find Apache won’t start when we come to the end of this guide. Also while you’re here, click on “Disable modsecparse.pl”. This will disable the cPanel cron job that processes and empties the mod_security log, allowing you to use the log watching tool built in to CMC.As to help our VPS and Dedicated Server customers who might also be effected by this we have designed the following guide to make installing Atmoic Mod Security into cPanel with little to no fuss.Stage 1: Run the following commands at command line:mkdir /var/aslmkdir /var/asl/tmpmkdir /var/asl/datamkdir /var/asl/data/msamkdir /var/asl/data/auditmkdir /var/asl/data/suspiciouschown nobody.nobody /var/asl/data/msachown nobody.nobody /var/asl/data/auditchown nobody.nobody /var/asl/data/suspiciouschmod o-rx -R /var/asl/data/*chmod ug+rwx -R /var/asl/data/*mkdir /var/asl/updatesmkdir /var/asl/rules/mkdir /var/asl/rules/clamavmkdir /etc/asl/touch /etc/asl/whitelistcd /usr/local/src/wget http://updates.atomicorp.com/channels/r ... est.tar.gzOrwget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/305 ... %29.tar.gztar zxvf modsec-2.7-free-latest.tar.gzmkdir /usr/local/apache/conf/modsec_rules/cp modsec/* /usr/local/apache/conf/modsec_rules/These command will create the required directory’s and download the latest free version of the Atomic Mod Security rules. It will also directly install them into the location of Apache designed for cPanel and configure the permission.Stage 2: Configure cPanel to use the Mod Security RulesIn this stage, you can do everything from WHM as long as you have Mod Security already installed as part of your EasyApache build.

It is always advised to use complex passwords other than using simple ones to avoid this kind of an attack. But still the password authentication method has a possible risk of a brute-force attack using some scripts with the commonly used passwords.Why key-based authentication is more secure?The key-based authentication is using a method authentication via two cryptographically secure keys. In simple words, we are creating a key pair from our local computer and using them for the authentication process. One of the keys is a public key that needs to be added to the servers and the other one is a private key and which needs to be kept on the computer itself safely. For added security, we can encrypt the private key with a password-protection as well. The authentication works based on these pair and once the keys are matched in the server and the local machine, the authentication works and you will get SSH access. This method is considered as more secure as it contains different levels of security and the chance of a brute-force attack is avoided as well.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'How remove a blocked IP from WHM panel', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/376/How-remove-a-blocked-IP-from-WHM-panel.html'}, page_content=\"If the CSF firewall is installed on the WHM server, we can remove IPs from the blacklist from the WHM panel itself.

It makes managing files, software, and settings on a remote server easier for users who are not yet comfortable with the command line.In this guide, we will be setting up VNC on an Ubuntu 16.04 server and connecting to it securely through an SSH tunnel. The VNC server we will be using is TightVNC, a fast and lightweight remote control package. This choice will ensure that our VNC connection will be smooth and stable even on slower internet connections.PrerequisitesTo complete this tutorial, you\\'ll need:An Ubuntu 16.04 Droplet set up via theUbuntu 16.04 initial server setup tutorial, which includes having a sudo non-root user. Note that this tutorial can be completed using any size Droplet, but a VNC built on a smaller droplet may have more limits on functionality than a larger one.A local computer with a VNC client installed that supports VNC connections over SSH tunnels. If you are using Windows, you could use TightVNC, RealVNC, or UltraVNC. Mac OS X users can use the built-in Screen Sharing program, or can use a cross-platform app like RealVNC. Linux users can choose from many options:vinagre,krdc, RealVNC, TightVNC, and more.Step 1 — Installing the Desktop Environment and VNC ServerBy default, an Ubuntu 16.04 Droplet does not come with a graphical desktop environment or a VNC server installed, so we\\'ll begin by installing those. Specifically, we will install packages for the latest Xfce desktop environment and the TightVNC package available in the official Ubuntu repository.On your server, install the Xfce and TightVNC packages.sudo apt-get updatesudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tightvncserverTo complete the VNC server\\'s initial configuration after installation, use thevncservercommand to set up a secure password.vncserverYou\\'ll be prompted to enter and verify a password, and also a view-only password. Users who log in with the view-only password will not be able to control the VNC instance with their mouse or keyboard. This is a helpful option if you want to demonstrate something to other people using your VNC server, but isn\\'t necessary.Runningvncservercompletes the installation of VNC by creating default configuration files and connection information for our server to use. With these packages installed, you are now ready to configure your VNC server.Step 2 — Configuring the VNC ServerFirst, we need to tell our VNC server what commands to perform when it starts up. These commands are located in a configuration file calledxstartupin the.vncfolder under your home directory. The startup script was created when you ran thevncserverin the previous step, but we need modify some of the commands for the Xfce desktop.When VNC is first set up, it launches a default server instance on port 5901. This port is called a display port, and is referred to by VNC as:1. VNC can launch multiple instances on other display ports, like:2,:3, etc. When working with VNC servers, remember that:Xis a display port that refers to5900+X.Because we are going to be changing how the VNC server is configured, we\\'ll need to first stop the VNC server instance that is running on port 5901.vncserver -kill :1The output should look like this, with a different PID:OutputKilling Xtightvnc process ID 17648Before we begin configuring the newxstartupfile, let\\'s back up the original.mv ~/.vnc/xstartup ~/.vnc/xstartup.bakNow create a newxstartupfile withnanoor your favorite text editor.nano ~/.vnc/xstartupPaste these commands into the file so that they are performed automatically whenever you start or restart the VNC server, then save and close the file.~/.vnc/xstartup#!/bin/bash\\r\\nxrdb $HOME/.Xresources\\r\\nstartxfce4 &The first command in the file,xrdb $HOME/.Xresources, tells VNC\\'s GUI framework to read the server user\\'s.Xresourcesfile..Xresourcesis where a user can make changes to certain settings of the graphical desktop, like terminal colors, cursor themes, and font rendering. The second command simply tells the server to launch Xfce, which is where you will find all of the graphical software that you need to comfortably manage your server.To ensure that the VNC server will be able to use this new startup file properly, we\\'ll need to grant executable privileges to it.sudo chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartupNow, restart the VNC server.vncserverThe server should be started with an output similar to this:OutputNew \\'X\\' desktop is your_server_name.com:1\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting applications specified in /home/sammy/.vnc/xstartup\\r\\nLog file is /home/sammy/.vnc/liniverse.com:1.logStep 3 — Testing the VNC DesktopIn this step, we\\'ll test the connectivity of your VNC server.First, we need to create an SSH connection on your local computer that securely forwards to thelocalhostconnection for VNC. You can do this via the terminal on Linux or OS X with following command. Remember to replaceuserandserver_ip_addresswith the sudo non-root username and IP address of your server.ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -N -f -lusernameserver_ip_addressIf you are using a graphical SSH client, like PuTTY, useserver_ip_addressas the connection IP, and setlocalhost:5901as a new forwarded port in the program\\'s SSH tunnel settings.Next, you may now use a VNC client to attempt a connection to the VNC server atlocalhost:5901. You\\'ll be prompted to authenticate. The correct password to use is the one you set in Step 1.Once you are connected, you should see the default Xfce desktop. It should look something like this:You can access files in your home directory with the file manager or from the command line, as seen here:Step 4 — Creating a VNC Service FileNext, we\\'ll set up the VNC server as a systemd service. This will make it possible to start, stop, and restart it as needed, like any other systemd service.First, create a new unit file called/etc/systemd/system/[email\\xa0protected]using your favorite text editor:sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/[email\\xa0protected]Copy and paste the following into it. Be sure to change the value ofUserand the username in the value ofPIDFILEto match your username./etc/systemd/system/[email\\xa0protected][Unit]\\r\\nDescription=Start TightVNC server at startup\\r\\nAfter=syslog.target network.target\\r\\n\\r\\n[Service]\\r\\nType=forking\\r\\nUser=sammyPAMName=login\\r\\nPIDFile=/home/sammy/.vnc/%H:%i.pid\\r\\nExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i > /dev/null 2>&1\\r\\nExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1280x800 :%i\\r\\nExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i\\r\\n\\r\\n[Install]\\r\\nWantedBy=multi-user.targetSave and close the file.Next, make the system aware of the new unit file.sudo systemctl daemon-reloadEnable the unit file.sudo systemctl enable[email\\xa0protected]The1following the@sign signifies which display number the service should appear over, in this case the default:1as was discussed above.Stop the current instance of the VNC server if it\\'s still running.vncserver -kill :1Then start it as you would start any other systemd service.sudo systemctl start vncserver@1You can verify that it started with this command:sudo systemctl status vncserver@1If it started correctly, the output should look like this:Output[email\\xa0protected]- TightVNC server on Ubuntu 16.04\\r\\n   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/[email\\xa0protected]; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)Active: active (running)since Mon 2016-04-25 03:21:34 EDT; 6s ago\\r\\n  Process: 2924 ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\n systemd[1]: Starting TightVNC server on Ubuntu 16.04...\\r\\n systemd[2938]: pam_unix(login:session): session opened for user finid by (uid=0)\\r\\n systemd[2949]: pam_unix(login:session): session opened for user finid by (uid=0)\\r\\n systemd[1]: Started TightVNC server on Ubuntu 16.04.ConclusionYou should now have a secured VNC server up and running on your Ubuntu 16.04 server.

Alternately you can use the cPanel File Manager to upload materials.When the addon domain website is available to visitors depends on when you changed the name servers to point to your main account name servers. DNS changes take a bit of time to propagate throughout the internet, and that period varies depending on several factors.Typically though, DNS changes shouldn’t take more than a few hours to propagate. At which point, you can access the new site.Email for an Addon domainYou canset up email accountsfor your addon domains in cPanel. The domain will be an option in the drop-down menu.How to Enable or Disable Addon Domain RedirectionIn the “Modify Addon Domain” section, click the “Manage Redirection” link corresponding to the domain you wish to manage.Enter the URL that you would like the addon domain to redirect to in the “Domain […] redirects to” field.Click the “Save” button.To Disable an Addon Domain RedirectClick the “Manage Redirection” link corresponding to the addon domain you wish to manage.In the “Disable Addon Domain Redirection” section, click the “Disable Redirection” button.Where to Upload Website Files for an Addon DomainWhen you set up an Addon domain, the system creates a directory with the same name as the domain. That is unless you specified a different directory name in the “Document Root” field during the setup.So, for example, if your new domain was ggexample.org, the directory would be /ggexample.org.All files for ggexample.org would be uploaded to/public_html/ggexample.org.How to Remove or Delete an Addon DomainIn the “Modify Addon Domain” section, click the “Remove” link for the domain you would like to remove.Click the “Remove” button.The directory that your addon domain points to will not be removed. If you no longer need the directory, you can delete it via FTP or by logging in the cPanel File Manager.Addon Domains are Separate WebsitesIt’s worth mentioning again that addon domains are different than alias domains in cPanel. An alias is an additional domain that points to your main website. So ggexample.com and the alias domain ggexample.net would lead to the same site. Longtime cPanel users may remember alias domains under their previous name, “Parked Domains.”You can view the video KB of this by clickinghere.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'How to Upgrade Linux Kernel in Ubuntu 16.04 Server', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/164/How-to-Upgrade-Linux-Kernel-in-Ubuntu-16.04-Server.html'}, page_content=\"tep 1 - Update Ubuntu Repository and Upgrade all PackagesThe first thing we want to do before we upgrade the kernel is to update the Ubuntu repositories and to upgrade all packages to their latest versions.Connect to your ubuntu server through SSH login.

Reading from and writing to swap is slower than using memory, but it can provide a good safety net for when your server is low on memory.Without swap, a server that runs out of memory may start killing applications to free up memory, or even crash. This can cause you to lose unsaved data or experience downtime. To ensure reliable data access, some applications require swap to function.In this guide, we will cover how to create and enable a swap file on a CentOS 7 server. You can watch the video for the same by clickinghere.PrerequisitesBefore you begin with this guide, there are a few steps that need to be completed first.You will need a CentOS 7 server installed and configured with a non-root user that hassudoprivileges. If you haven\\'t done this yet, you can run through steps 1-4 in theCentOS 7 initial server setup guideto create this account.Once you have your non-root user, you can use it to SSH into your CentOS server and continue with the installation of your swap file.Check the System for Swap InformationBefore we begin, we should take a look at our server\\'s storage to see if we already have some swap space available. While we can have multiple swap files or swap partitions, one should generally be enough.We can see if the system has any configured swap by usingswapon, a general-purpose swap utility. With the-sflag,swaponwill display a summary of swap usage and availability on our storage device:swapon -sIf nothing is returned by the command, then the summary was empty and no swap file exists.Another way of checking for swap space is with thefreeutility, which shows us the system\\'s overall memory usage. We can see our current memory and swap usage (in megabytes) by typing:free -mtotal       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\\r\\nMem:          3953        315       3637          8         11        107\\r\\n-/+ buffers/cache:        196       3756Swap:            00       4095As you can see, our total swap space in the system is 0. This matches what we saw withswapon.Check Available Storage SpaceThe typical way of allocating space for swap is to use a separate partition that is dedicated to the task. However, altering the partition scheme is not always possible due to hardware or software constraints. Fortunately, we can just as easily create a swap file that resides on an existing partition.Before we do this, we should be aware of our current drive usage. We can get this information by typing:df -hFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on/dev/vda1        59G  1.5G   55G   3% /devtmpfs        2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev\\r\\ntmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm\\r\\ntmpfs           2.0G  8.3M  2.0G   1% /run\\r\\ntmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /sys/fs/cgroupNote:the-hflag simply tellsdhto output drive information in a human-friendly reading format. For example, instead of outputting the raw number of memory blocks in a partition,df -hwill tell us the space usage and availability in M (for megabytes) or G (for gigabytes).As you can see on the first line, our storage partition has 59 gigabytes available, so we have quite a bit of space to work with. Keep in mind that this is on a fresh, medium-sized VPS instance, so your actual usage might be very different.Although there are many opinions about the appropriate size of a swap space, it really depends on your application requirements and your personal preferences. Generally, an amount equal to or double the amount of memory on your system is a good starting point.Since my system has 4 gigabytes of memory, and doubling that would take a larger chunk from my storage space than I am willing to part with, I will create a swap space of 4 gigabytes to match my system\\'s memory.Create a Swap FileNow that we know our available storage space, we can go about creating a swap file within our filesystem. We will create a file calledswapfilein our root (/) directory, though you can name the file something else if you prefer. The file must allocate the amount of space that we want for our swap file.The fastest and easiest way to create a swap file is by usingfallocate. This command creates a file of a preallocated size instantly. We can create a 4 gigabyte file by typing:sudo fallocate -l4G/swapfileAfter entering your password to authorizesudoprivileges, the swap file will be created almost instantly, and the prompt will be returned to you. We can verify that the correct amount of space was reserved for swap by usingls:ls -lh/swapfile-rw-r--r-- 1 root root4.0GOct 30 11:00/swapfileAs you can see, our swap file was created with the correct amount of space set aside.Enable a Swap FileRight now, our file is created, but our system does not know that this is supposed to be used for swap. We need to tell our system to format this file as swap and then enable it.Before we do that, we should adjust the permissions on our swap file so that it isn\\'t readable by anyone besides the root account. Allowing other users to read or write to this file would be a huge security risk. We can lock down the permissions withchmod:sudo chmod 600/swapfileThis will restrict both read and write permissions to the root account only. We can verify that the swap file has the correct permissions by usingls -lhagain:ls -lh/swapfile-rw------- 1 root root4.0GOct 30 11:00/swapfileNow that our swap file is more secure, we can tell our system to set up the swap space for use by typing:sudo mkswap/swapfileSetting up swapspace version 1, size =4194300KiB\\r\\nno label, UUID=b99230bb-21af-47bc-8c37-de41129c39bfOur swap file is now ready to be used as a swap space. We can begin using it by typing:sudo swapon/swapfileTo verify that the procedure was successful, we can check whether our system reports swap space now:swapon -sFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority/swapfilefile41943000     -1This output confirms that we have a new swap file. We can use thefreeutility again to corroborate our findings:free -mtotal       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\\r\\nMem:          3953        315       3637          8         11        107\\r\\n-/+ buffers/cache:        196       3756Swap:         40950       4095Our swap has been set up successfully, and our operating system will begin to use it as needed.Make the Swap File PermanentOur swap file is enabled at the moment, but when we reboot, the server will not automatically enable the file for use. We can change that by modifying thefstabfile, which is a table that manages filesystems and partitions.Edit the file withsudoprivileges in your text editor:sudo nano /etc/fstabAt the bottom of the file, you need to add a line that will tell the operating system to automatically use the swap file that you created:/swapfileswap    swap    sw  0   0When you are finished adding the line, you can save and close the file. The server will check this file on each bootup, so the swap file will be ready for use from now on.Tweak Your Swap Settings (Optional)There are a few options that you can configure that will have an impact on your system\\'s performance when dealing with swap. These configurations are optional in most cases, and the changes that you make will depend on your application needs and your personal preference.SwappinessTheswappinessparameter determines how often your system swaps data out of memory to the swap space. This is a value between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of memory usage that will trigger the use of swap.With values close to zero, the system will not swap data to the drive unless absolutely necessary. Remember, interactions with the swap file are \"expensive\" in that they are a lot slower than interactions with memory, and this difference in read and write speed can cause a significant reduction in an application\\'s performance. Telling the system not to rely on the swap as much will generally make your system faster.Values that are closer to 100 will try to put more data into swap in an effort to keep more memory free. Depending on your applications\\' memory profile, or what you are using your server for, this might be the better choice in some cases.We can see the current swappiness value by reading theswappinessconfiguration file:cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness30CentOS 7 defaults to a swappiness setting of 30, which is a fair middle ground for most desktops and local servers. For a VPS system, we\\'d probably want to move it closer to 0.We can set the swappiness to a different value by using thesysctlcommand. For instance, to set the swappiness to 10, we could type:sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10vm.swappiness =10This setting will persist until the next reboot. To make the setting persist between reboots, we can add the outputted line to oursysctlconfiguration file:sudo nano /etc/sysctl.confAdd your swappiness setting to the bottom of the file:vm.swappiness =10When you are finished adding the line, you can save and close the file. The server will now automatically set the swappiness to the value you declared on each bootup.Cache PressureAnother related value that you might want to modify is thevfs_cache_pressure. This setting affects the storage of special filesystem metadata entries. Constantly reading and refreshing this information is generally very costly, so storing it on the cache for longer is excellent for your system\\'s performance.You can see the current value of this cache pressure by querying theprocfilesystem again:cat /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure100As it is currently configured, our system removes inode information from the cache far too quickly. We can set this to a more conservative setting, like 50, by usingsysctl:sudo sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50vm.vfs_cache_pressure =50Again, this is only valid for our current session. We can change that by adding it to our configuration file, like we did with our swappiness setting:sudo nano /etc/sysctl.confAt the bottom, add the line that specifies your new value:vm.vfs_cache_pressure =50When you are finished adding the line, you can save and close the file. The server will now automatically set the cache pressure to the value you declared on each bootup.ConclusionBy following the steps in this guide, you will have given your server some breathing room in terms of memory usage. Swap space is incredibly useful in avoiding some common problems.If you are running into OOM (out of memory) errors, or if you find that your system is unable to use the applications that you need, the best solution is to optimize your application configurations or upgrade your server. However, configuring swap space can give you more flexibility and can help buy you time on a less powerful server.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'How to allow/deny traffic by country in CSF firewall via WHM', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/329/How-to-allowordeny-traffic-by-country-in-CSF-firewall-via-WHM.html'}, page_content=\"We can make restrictions for the server access based on countries using unique country codes via the CSF interface in WHM.

Useful in detecting a single flood by allowing you to recognize many connections coming from one IP.netstat -n -p|grep SYN_REC | wc -lThis command is useful to find out how many active SYNC_REC are occurring on the server. The number should be pretty low, preferably less than 5. On DoS attack incidents or mail bombs, the number can jump to pretty high. However, the value always depends on the system, so a high value may be average on another server.netstat -n -p | grep SYN_REC | sort -uList out the all IP addresses involved instead of just count.netstat -n -p | grep SYN_REC | awk '{print $5}' | awk -F: '{print $1}'List all the unique IP addresses of the node that are sending SYN_REC connection status.netstat -ntu | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort |uniq-c | sort -nUse netstat command to calculate and count the number of connections each IP address makes to the server.netstat -anp |grep 'tcp|udp' | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nList count of number of connections the IPs are connected to the server using TCP or UDP protocol.netstat -ntu | grep ESTAB | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort |uniq-c | sort -nrCheck on ESTABLISHED connections instead of all connections, and displays the connections count for each IP.netstat -plan|grep :80|awk {'print $5'}|cut -d: -f 1|sort|uniq -c|sort -nk 1Show and list IP address and its connection count that connect to port 80 on the server.

First, we need to enable the 'chroot_local_user' option in the vsftpd configuration:# nano /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.confCheck if the entry 'chroot_local_user' is already there, if not add it like the following:chroot_local_user=YESIf the user needs write permissions also, you need to add the following line as well:allow_writeable_chroot=YESOnce done, save the file and restart the service:# service vsftpd restart2. Create a new FTP user and set a password:#useradd ftpuser#passwd ftpuser3. Change the default home directory of the user to '/var/www/html/dev'# usermod -d /var/www/html/dev/ ftpuser4. In order to provide access to this user to the '/var/www/html/dev' directory, either we need to set the user and group ownership of the directory to this user.# chown -R ftpuser:ftpuser /var/www/html/devBut in some cases, there is another FTP user who is already having ownership and having access to that folder and hence we cannot change the ownership. In that case, we can add this new user in the same group of that privileged user.Eg: If the user called 'sam' is the main developer of the website and he needs to give the 'ftpuser' account to his junior to work only inside the dev folder. So the best way is to add 'ftpuser' to the group of the user 'sam':# usermod -a -G sam ftpuserOnce this is done, you are done and the user 'ftpuser' will be able to connect via FTP to that particular folder only.\"),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'How to create and manage FTP accounts in cPanel', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/287/How-to-create-and-manage-FTP-accounts-in-cPanel.html'}, page_content=\"You can create and manage the FTP accounts from your cPanel interface itself.

At least 20 GB of free disk space. Please check the disk space with the command “df -h”2. SSH access. Please make sure the process is not closed in between.Step 1: Backup all your dataPlease take a backup of all important files before you start the upgrade process.Step 2: Update your systemInitially, you will need to ensure whether the packages on Ubuntu 20.04 are up to date through the following command:#apt updateTo list upgradable packages, run the command:#\\xa0apt list –upgradableIf some packages require to be upgraded, you can use the following command to upgrade them.#apt upgradeWhen prompted on what to do with the modified “sshd_config” configuration file, you can choose to install the package maintainer’s version or keep the local version installed. Then, select ‘Ok’.This might take a while depending on the number of installed packages with pending upgrades.

We also recommend speaking with your networking team beforehand to ensure you are minimizing potential security risks. Be sure to follow Step 6 below to close the port when you are done.# sudoufw allow 1022/tcpTo apply the firewall rule, reload the firewall.# sudoufw reloadThen verify that the port has been opened by probing the firewall status as shown.# sudoufw statusStep 4: Upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy JellyfishAt this point, upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 will be a straightforward and seamless process. There are two ways to upgrade to the latest Ubuntu version: You can use the do-release-upgrade tool, which works for both CLI and GUI instances, or the GUI update tool.In this guide, we will use the do-release-upgrade tool.To commence the upgrade, run the command:# do-release-upgrade -dDuring the upgrade, the upgrade tool will probe for the latest LTS release and walk you through a series of prompts.First and foremost, it will detect your SSH connection and notify you that an additional SSH service will be started on port 1022. Simply type “Y” to proceed.Next, the upgrade tool will notify you to open port 1022, which will be used as an alternative SSH port in case of an SSH connection interruption on the default port. Since you already opened the port, just hit ENTER.The update tool will calculate all the changes and provide a summary of the following:1. Installed packages that are no longer supported by Canonical.2. The number of packages to be removed.3. The number of new packages that will be installed.4. The number of packages that will be upgraded.5. Total download size and how long the download will take.Some services will need to be restarted once some libraries and packages are upgraded. On this pop-up, select ‘Yes‘ to restart these services during package upgrades without being prompted.From here, the upgrade tool will proceed to download all the requisite packages from the official Ubuntu repositories and upgrade them.When prompted on what to do with the modified “sshd_config” configuration file, you can choose to install the package maintainer’s version or keep the local version installed. Then, select ‘Ok’.Next, press “Y” and hit ENTER to remove obsolete packages.The entire process takes quite some time.Once the upgrade is complete, you will be prompted to restart the system to finish the upgrade.

Also, note that we are using kernel 5.15 which is the kernel version that comes with Ubuntu 22.04 by default.Step 6: Delete the firewall rule you createdNow that you are finished with the update and no longer need port 1022 open, run the following command to close the port and prevent it from becoming a security vulnerability.#ufw delete allow 1022/tcpStep 7: Enable third-party repositoriesDuring the upgrade, all third-party repositories are disabled. You might want to re-enable them now that the upgrade is complete. You can find these repositories in the/etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.To display these repositories, run the command:# ls -l etc/apt/sources.list.d/To enable them, simply open each file and uncomment the entries by deleting the # sign at the beginning of each line.Finally, free up the disk space by removing all the unnecessary packages as follows:# apt autoremove --purge'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'How to upgrade the VPS from client area', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/314/How-to-upgrade-the-VPS-from-client-area.html'}, page_content=\"You can simply upgrade your VPS servers via your client area itself without any data loss.

They did so for a variety of reasons, mainly for cost. Retail, in particular, has been badly hit with shops closing and income plummeting. Their only survival option is to move to an online presence with an e-commerce platform. In many cases, cost considerations and a need to implement quickly mean that an MSP is the only option.All businesses with internal IT systems experience downtime for a variety of reasons. It’s a fact of life that the infrastructure will fail from time to time, usually at the worst possible time. MSP’s, while trying not to, do also have downtime.Downtime Types and ReasonsThe first thing to understand is that downtime is sometimes outside the MSP’scontrol. Not being able to access systems through an Internet connection does not necessarily mean that the systems are down, just that your connection to the MSPhas failed. Internet connections pass through a series of third parties, and if any link in the chain is broken, the entire chain is broken.What also needs to be understood is that there are several classes of downtime:1.Catastrophic. The entire Data Centre is inoperable, usually because of a power outage. There should be backup power arrangements, but these may only last for a limited time.2.Total. The Datacenter is up and running, and you can connect to it, but your business systems are wholly unavailable or unresponsive;3.Partial. The Datacenter is up and running, and you can connect to it, but parts of your business systems, perhaps integration with other systems, are unavailable or unresponsive;4.Irritating. You can carry on with normal business operations, but some functions are not available.Common reasons for downtime include:1.Equipment failure. Something as simple as a cooling fan in a piece of equipment failing can shut it down.2.Software failures. Some software systems automatically download and install upgrades. From time to time, they can cause the systems themselves or their integrations to fail. In very rare cases, operating systems close down.3.Malicious activities. Targeted attacks on the Data Centre and malware can cause downtime.4.Force Majeure. In some countries, government restrictions can cause DataCentres to close entirely or restrict their connectivity. For example, in Ethiopia Internet connectivity is supplied through a single source, the parastatal, Ethiotel. During civil unrest, the Government has instructed Ethiotelto, simply put, switch off the Internet and cellphone services.Avoidance Measures1.Power loss. The Data Centre has backup power arrangements. These are usually at two levels, batteries to cover for short outages, and generators for longer-term power losses. Backup planning must include a provision to refill the diesel tanks, and what to do if a generator fails.2.Equipment Failure. This is usually following an equipment failure in a critical device. It can be as simple as a cooling fan failure. Most key equipment has hot-swappable components and failure alerts, minimizing potential downtime. Using Raid can protect disk storage against a single disk unit failure. SSD units have a limited lifetime but are immune from mechanical failure.3.Malware. The FBI has recorded an upsurge in malicious activities over the last year. DDoS attacks have increased in number and viciousness, and they theorize that could be due to online merchants trying to block competitors. Other vectors like Phishing have shown similar increases, and fraudsters try to take advantage of the confusion. An MSP must have comprehensive anti-malware defenses in place and in a shared environment insulate one customer from the actions of another. Network monitoring will show up network attacks to be blocked before they cause a loss of service.4.Force Majeure. There is little you can do unless there is an alternative route to get around the issue. One technique is to have a second Data Centre in another jurisdiction as a hot-standby and route all customer traffic to that site. MSPs like HostSailor with sites in multiple countries are better positioned to offset local actions.MSPs like Host Sailor take uptime and service levels very seriously. When downtime happens, it reflects not only on the customer but also on the MSP, causing great reputational damage. They make great efforts to provide a safe and secure environment for their customers.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'Managing MySQL databases from cPanel', 'source': 'https://clients.hostsailor.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/261/Managing-MySQL-databases-from-cPanel.html'}, page_content=\"We can simply manage the MySQL databases from the cPanel interface itself.
